then talk about simple models + course questions we will answer

Arrange the following questions!

Handout 6(21)-1: ANSWER SHEET
Possible answers may include: 
Microeconomic Questions	Macroeconomic Questions
Example:
What factors affect hiring decisions of a typical firm? 	
What factors affect the unemployment rate?
Why would a typical consumer buy fewer goods than before? If the demand for a certain good or service falls, how does it affect the output of a typical firm?	How does a fall in consumer spending affect the country’s output? 
If the price of a certain good or service rises, how would it affect buying decisions of a typical consumer? If the price of a certain good or service rises, how would it affect production decisions of a typical firm? 	How does inflation affect the economy?
If the government imposes the tax on sales of a certain good or service, how would the market prices and quantities of that good or service change? If the government taxes the consumer’s income, how would it affect buying decisions of a typical consumer? 	If the government raises taxes, how would it affect the economy?

For Inquiring Minds 
Defining Recessions and Expansions—This FIM explains how recessions are defined (and that there is no exact definition!). 



. The Business Cycle 
A.	Charting the business cycle 
1.	Over time, major economic indicators increase, but it’s not a steady upward trend: In the early 1990s, the early 2000s, 2007, and 2020, both employment and industrial output stumbled. The uneven pace of the economy’s progress is one of the main preoccupations of macroeconomics. 
2.	The business cycle is made up of recessions (also called contractions), which are periods of economic downturn when output and employment are falling, and expansions (also called recoveries), which are periods of economic upturn when output and employment are rising. 
3.	The business-cycle peak is the point in time at which the economy shifts from expansion to recession. 
4.	The business-cycle trough is the point in time at which the economy shifts from recession to expansion. 
B.	The pain of recession 
1.	The pain of recession is felt by workers who are unable to find or hold jobs.
2.	Because recessions cause many people to lose their jobs and make it hard to find new ones, they reduce the standard of living across the country.
C.	Taming the business cycle 
1.	Modern macroeconomics largely came into being as a response to the recession of 1929–1933 that ushered the Great Depression.
2.	John Maynard Keynes suggested that policy makers should use monetary and fiscal policies to mitigate the effects of recessions, and Milton Friedman argued that it’s important to rein in booms as well as to fight slumps.
3.	Although fiscal and monetary policies haven’t been completely successful, they have helped make the economy more stable. 
III. Long-Run Economic Growth 
A.	Long-run economic growth is the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services the economy produces. fundamental to many of the most pressing economic questions of the day. 
B.	Long-run growth per capita — a sustained upward trend in output per person — is the key to higher wages and a rising standard of living. 
C.	Long-run economic growth is a modern invention: Britain, for example, wasn’t any richer in 1650 than it was two centuries earlier. Countries don’t grow at the same rate. For example, Britain was much richer than the United States, but the United States grew faster after 1875.
D.	 Macroeconomists do not use the same models to think about long-run growth as they use to think about the business cycle. 
IV. Inflation and Deflation 
A.		A rising level of prices is inflation. A falling level of prices is deflation. 
B.	In the short run, movements in inflation are closely related to the business cycle. When the economy is depressed, inflation tends to fall; when the economy is booming, inflation tends to rise.
C.	In the long run, the overall level of prices is mainly determined by changes in the money supply. 
D.	The pain of inflation and deflation: inflation discourages people from holding onto cash, because cash loses value over time; deflation can cause the reverse problem when holding on to cash is more attractive than investing in productive assets which can deepen a recession.
E.	Price stability is the situation when the overall level of prices changes slowly. Price stability is a desirable goal, and from the 1990s to the present, it has been achieved. 
V. International Imbalances 
A.	An open economy is an economy that trades goods, services, and assets with other countries. 
B.	When a country imports more than it exports, it runs a trade deficit. Otherwise, it runs a trade surplus.
C.	A trade deficit is not necessarily bad, and a trade surplus is not necessarily good. Whether a country runs a trade surplus or a trade deficit depends on the country’s savings and investments.





Do you think Qatar is an relatively open or closed economy? 

•	Ask students what products they have purchased that were produced in another country. Create a list of these items. Then ask students to name some products the United States has produced and sold to other countries. Create a list of these items. It will likely be easier for students to name imports they have purchased than exports the United States has sold.

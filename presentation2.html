# What will you learn in the next two lectures?

- __How do economists use aggregate measures to track the performance of the economy?__

--

- __What is gross domestic product (GDP), and how is it calculated?__

--

- _What is the difference between real GDP and nominal GDP, and why is real GDP the appropriate measure of real economic activity?_

--

- _What is a price index, and how is it used to calculate the inflation rate?_

---

# The National Accounts

- The formal way we measure key aspects of an economy, and how can we compare economies.

--

- We use the national income and product accounts, often referred to as the national accounts. 

--

- The national accounts keep track of spending of consumers, sales of producers, business investment spending, government purchases, and other flows of money between different sectors of the economy.

# The National Accounts

- Consumer spending is household spending on goods and services.

--

- Government purchases of goods and services are total expenditures on goods and services by federal, state, and local governments.

--

- Investment spending is spending on productive physical capital (such as machinery and construction of buildings) and on changes to inventories.

--

- Goods and services sold to other countries are exports. Goods and services purchased from other countries are imports.

--

- If we add up consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases, exports and subtract imports, we will get the market value of the goods and services the economy produces—the country’s gross domestic product.

--

__Digression: Stocks and Flows__

- The distinction between a stock and a flow is very important in economic measurement and national income accounting

- A stock is a position at a moment of time, for example,
the stock of inventories in the economy at year end 2021

- A flow is the rate of change in a stock, for example, the
change in the stock of inventories in the economy in
2005 ..(Profit and loss statements report flows

# Gross Domestic Product

__Definition__

&gt; GDP or gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a
country in a given time period.

This definition has four parts:

  1. Market value

  2. Final goods and services

  3. Produced within a country

  4. In a given time period

__Excludes__ financial transactions and income transfers
since these do not reflect production

__Net additions to inventory__ are current period output so are also included 


- How to measure GDP ? 

&gt; GDP measures the value of production, which also equals total expenditure on final goods and total income.

---

# Calculating GDP


Gross domestic product (GDP): the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a given year:

- Goods and services are final if they are sold to the final, or end, user. 
- Goods and services are intermediate if the purchaser—another firm—is not the final user.

  - If you buy a car from a dealer, the car is a final good. If an automobile manufacturer buys steel from a steel foundry, that steel is an intermediate good. 

  
- Market Value
  - GDP is a market value-goods and services are valued at their market prices.
  - To add apples and oranges, computers and popcorn, we add the market values so we have a total value of output in dollars.

- __Final Goods and Services__
  - GDP is the value of the final goods and services produced.
  - A final good (or service) is an item bought by its final user during a specified time period.
  - Excluding the value of intermediate goods and services avoids counting the same value more than once.

# Calculating GDP

&gt; GDP Equals Expenditure Equals Income

Total expenditure on final goods and services equals GDP.
- GDP `\(=C+I+G+X-I M\)`.


- Aggregate income equals the total amount paid for the use of factors of production: wages, interest, rent, and profit.



&gt; GDP can be calculated in three ways:

1. Add up the total value of all final goods and services produced

2. Add up all aggregate spending on domestically produced final goods and services

3. Add up the total factor income earned by households from firms in the economy

It doesn’t matter if we add up all the spending or all the incomes because one person’s spending is another person’s income.

---

# Example

This hypothetical economy consists of three firms. GDP can be calculated:  

1. as the value of final goods and services 
2. as aggregate spending on domestically produced final goods and services
3. as factor income earned by households from firms in the economy

#  GDP as Spendind on domestic production

&gt; Add up all spending on domestically produced final goods and services. 

__Aggregate spending:__ the sum of consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases of goods and services, and exports minus imports


$$
GDP = C + I + G + X – IM 
$$
- C = consumer spending
  - Consumer Durables: "has a life of over 3 years: cars, furniture, etc"
  - Consumer Non Durables: "food, utilities, clothing"
  - Services: "Housing, healthcare, recreation, education"
- I = investment spending : adding to the capital stock
  - Residential Investment (homes)
  - Non residential Investment (business investments in structures and equipment)
  - Changes in Inventories (changes get registered)
- G = government purchases of goods and services
  - Government Expenditures reflect direct consumption, not transfers,  "Defense, Government investments in roads and other infrastructure"
  - Transfer payments represent money redistributed from one group of citizens (taxpayers) to another (poor, unemployed, elderly) `\(\rightarrow\)` Does not result in production of new goods and services

---

# External Accounts

- X = sales to foreigners, and
- IM = imports (purchases of foreign goods)
- Net Exports = NX = X


__Observe__

  - If NX = X- IM &gt; 0 Trade Surplus
  - If NX = X - IM &lt; 0 Trade Deficit

__Some examples of exports of services__

- Spending of foreign tourists in USA or Qatar:

  - transportation services

  - insurance / banking services

  - medical services

  - retail services (souvenirs)   

  - hotel accommodation services

# The expenditure approach

&lt;img src="week2graphs/expenditureapproach.png" width="70%" /&gt;

---

#  The Income Approach

&gt; The income approach measures GDP by summing the
incomes that firms pay households for the factors of
production they hire.


-  add all factor income earned from firms and workers in the economy;

  - The wages earned by labor
  - The interest paid on savings
  - The rent earned by those who lease their assets
  - Dividends paid to the shareholders

-- 
The National Income and Expenditure Accounts divide
incomes into two broad categories:

1. Compensation of employees

2. Net operating surplus

&gt; Compensation of employees is the payments for labor
services. The sum of net wages plus taxes withheld plus
social security and pension fund contributions.

&gt; Net operating surplus is the sum of other factor incomes. It
includes net interest, rental income, corporate profits, and
proprietor’s income.

# The Income approach

&lt;img src="week2graphs/incomeapproach.png" width="70%" /&gt;


---

# The value added approach


- Add up the value of all the final goods and services produced in the economy.

- We count only each producer’s value added in the calculation of GDP: the difference between the value of its sales and the value of the intermediate goods and services it purchases from other businesses. 


- It’s easy to confuse what is included in and excluded from GDP. For example, changes to inventories are included in GDP, but the steel used to make cars is not. Why? 

__We only include items that are newly produced and aren’t used up in production.__


- In
 - Investment spending
 - Capital spending (it’s part of investment spending)
 - Domestically produced final goods and services, including capital goods, new construction of structures, and changes to inventories
- Out 
 - Intermediate goods and services
 - Used goods
 -Financial assets like stocks and bonds

# Different approaches, same result

&lt;img src="week2graphs/2waysmeasure.png" width="60%" /&gt;

# What we will learn next:

- __Real GDP__
 - Aggregate output: the total quantity of final goods and services the economy produces 
 - We measure aggregate output by real GDP
 - calculated using the __prices of a selected base year__

- vs __Nominal GDP:__ the value of all final goods and services produced in the economy during a given year, calculated using the prices current in the year in which the output is produced


Remember GDP measures the size of the economy. 

- One must be careful when comparing economies over time. That’s because increases in GDP over time might represent increases in prices rather than increases in output. 

- We need to adjust GDP for price changes—we need real GDP!

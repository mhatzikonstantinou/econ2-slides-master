# What will you learn in this lecture?

-  How does the aggregate demand curve illustrate the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output demanded?

--

-  How does the aggregate supply curve illustrate the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output supplied?

--

-  Why is the aggregate supply curve different in the short run compared to the long run?

--


-  How is the AD–AS model used to analyze economic fluctuations?

--

-  How can monetary policy and fiscal policy stabilize the economy?

- Since contracts are renegotiated in the long run. In the long run, nominal wages will fully adjust to the aggregate price level.

- In the long run, the aggregate price level has no effect on the quantity of aggregate output supplied. 

- The long-run aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output supplied that holds if all prices are fully flexible.

- Potential output is the level of real GDP the economy would produce if all prices, including nominal wages, were fully flexible.

(they are flexible, not sticky). 
The long run is the time it takes for all prices (including nominal wages) to adjust.
In the long run, prices have no effect on aggregate output because prices (including nominal wages) are fully flexible.

???
If the theory of sticky wages were true, we’d find evidence that wages fail to fall even during periods of high unemployment. We do.

 - The economy is in short-run macroeconomic equilibrium when $Q_D=Q_S$

???
The short-run equilibrium aggregate price level is the aggregate price level in the short-run macroeconomic equilibrium.
Short-run equilibrium aggregate output is the quantity of aggregate output produced in the short-run macroeconomic equilibrium.

# Demand Shocks


```{r  out.width = "100%",out.length = "100%", fig.align = 'center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week11graphs/ADshock.png") 
```

 - An event that shifts the aggregate demand curve is a demand shock.

# Supply Shocks

```{r  out.width = "100%",out.length = "100%", fig.align = 'center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week11graphs/ASshock.png") 
```

 - An event that shifts the aggregate supply curve is a supply shock.

- __stagflation:__ the combination of inflation and falling aggregate output.

# Supply Shocks or Demand Shocks


- Which type of recession is more common?

```{r  out.width = "70%",out.length = "100%", fig.align = 'center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week11graphs/ADvsAS.png") 
```

???
Demand shocks are the usual culprit. Negative supply shocks are rare but nasty.

---

# A negative Demand Shock

```{r  out.width = "70%",out.length = "100%", fig.align = 'center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week11graphs/negative.png") 
```


???
In the long run the economy is self-correcting: demand shocks have only a short-run effect on aggregate output.
A negative demand shock shifts AD leftward, the economy moves to E2 and a recessionary gap arises: the aggregate price level and aggregate output both decline, and unemployment rises. 
But in the long run nominal wages fall in response to high unemployment, and SRAS shifts  rightward. Long-run macroeconomic equilibrium is restored at E3.



---

# A positive Demand Shock

```{r  out.width = "75%",out.length = "100%", fig.align = 'center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week11graphs/positive.png") 
```


???
Starting at E1, a positive demand shock shifts AD rightward, and the economy moves to E2 in the short run.
This results in an inflationary gap as aggregate output and the aggregate price level both rise, and unemployment falls. 
In the long run, nominal wages rise in response to low unemployment, and SRAS1 shifts leftward. The economy returns to long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.

# Policy response to Demand Shocks

> “But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.”
—J. M. Keynes

- If policy makers react quickly to the fall in aggregate demand, they can use monetary or fiscal policy to shift the aggregate demand curve back to the right.
- Instead of going through a recession, the government could make the economy stay at the original equilibrium.

# Policy response to Demand Shocks

- Macroeconomic policy would be desirable because: 
  - The temporary fall in aggregate output is associated with high unemployment.
  - Preventing deflation is a good thing.

--

- __Does this mean that policy makers should always act to offset declines in aggregate demand?__


--

- policy measures may have long-term costs in terms of lower long-run growth (budget deficits, for example).
- policy makers aren’t perfectly informed, and the effects of their policies aren’t perfectly predictable
- stabilization policies may have adverse effects.

- A negative supply shock leads to a rise in prices and a rise in unemployment, which poses a policy dilemma:
  - Stabilization of unemployment requires an increase in aggregate demand. This leads to inflation.
  - Stabilization of prices requires a decrease in aggregate demand. This leads to higher unemployment.

- In the 1970s, the United States chose to stabilize prices at the cost of higher unemployment.

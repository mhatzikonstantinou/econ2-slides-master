# Common Stock

- __Common stock__ is the principal way that corporations raise equity capital. 
  - Stockholders has the right to sell the stock
  - For publicly listed firms, this happens in secondary markets

--

- __Shareholders__: owners of stock
  -  ownership interest usually proportional to percentage of outstanding shares owned.   
    - right to vote and residual claimant of cash flows
    
--

- Stockholders are usually paid with __dividends__. Dividends depend on 
  - the source of funds/ net earnings of the corporation
  - the use of  funds/debt repayment or new investments
 
--

- Dividends are  made periodically, usually quarterly.

---

# Price of Common Stock

- We use the One-Period Valuation Model:


$$P_{0}=\frac{\operatorname{Div}_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)}+\frac{P_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)}$$
- $P_{0},P_{1}=$ the current and future price of the stock
- $\operatorname{Div}_{1}=$ the dividend paid at the end of year 1
- $k_{e}=$ the required return on investment in equity

--

Required return on investment in equity:
  - alternative returns
  - depends on preferences towards risk
  - prior information


---

class: my-one-page-font

# The Generalized Dividend Valuation Model:

The value of stock today is the present value of all future cash flows
$$P_{0}=\frac{D_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{1}}+\frac{D_{2}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{2}}+\ldots+\frac{D_{n}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{n}}+\frac{P_{n}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{n}}$$
--

- If $P_{n}$ is far in the future, it will not affect $P_{0}$!

$$P_{0}=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_{t}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{t}}$$

--

The price of the stock is determined only by the __present value of the future dividend stream__!
  - present value depends on required return 
  - What would dividends be, in 5,10,20,100 years?

---

class: my-one-page-font

# The Gordon Growth Model

- Corporations try to increase the rate of dividends:

$$P_{0}=\frac{D_{0}(1+g)}{\left(k_{e}-g\right)}=\frac{D_{1}}{\left(k_{e}-g\right)}$$
- $D_{0}=$ the most recent dividend paid
- $k_{e}=$ the required return on an investment in equity

--

- $g=$ the expected constant growth rate in dividends
  - Dividends are assumed to continue growing at a constant rate forever
  - The growth rate is assumed to be less than the required return on equity

# How the Market Sets Stock Prices  

- The price is set by the buyer willing to pay the highest price.
  - the buyer who can take best advantage of the asset.
  - the buyer with superior information about an asset 
  - more information can increase price by reducing perceived risk.

--

- Information is important for individuals to value each asset.
  - When new information is released about a firm, expectations and prices change.

--

- Market participants constantly receive information  
  - revise expectations
  - revise valuations
  - so stock prices change frequently.

# Rate of Return

- The rate of return from holding a security equals   
  - the sum of the capital gain on the security, + 
  - any cash payments /
  - by the initial purchase price of the security.


$$R_{t,t+1}=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}$$
- $R=$ the rate of return on the security
- $P_{t+1}=$ price of the security at time $t+1$, the end of the holding period
- $P_{t}=$ price of the security at time $t$, the beginning of the holding period
- $C=$ cash payment (coupon or dividend) made during the holding period
  - for stocks, this is the dividend   

---

class: my-one-page-font

# Rate of Return

- Observe, we could do the same between $t$ and $t+n$

$$R_{t,t+n}=\frac{P_{t+n}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}$$
- $R=$ the rate of return on the security
- $P_{t+n}=$ price of the security at time $t+1$, the end of the holding period
- $P_{t}=$ price of the security at time $t$, the beginning of the holding period
- $C=$ cash payment (coupon or dividend) made during the holding period
  - for stocks, this is the dividends received in these n periods

# Price Earnings Valuation Method

- Theoretically, we want to use Dividend Valuation Method
  - Difficult to apply. Dividends are hard to predict 

    
--

- Price earnings(PE) ratio
  - Provides an alternative
  - Based on other similar firms price/earnings
  - Price of firm's stock = the average industry PE times the expected earnings per share.
  
$$\frac{P}{E} \times E=P$$
--

- PE ratio is  widely followed
  - how much will investors pay for $1 of earnings 
  - it is high when:
      1. market expects earnings to rise
      2. market feels earnings are very low risk

# The Coronavirus Stock

- Market Crash of 2020

>  The spread of COVID triggered a stock market crash in which the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell from a peak of 29,551 on February 12 to 18,561 on March 20, a decline of 37%.

--

- What caused the crash?

  - The combination of expectations of a lower dividend growth rate $(g)$ +
  - a higher required return on investment in equity $\left(k_{e}\right)$

--

- Market Crash of 1987
  - Average Drop of 20 percent
  - Example: $(k_e=0.09+0.02),(g = 0.04)$ and $(D=7)$
  - What happens if interest rate and investors require 2 percent more?

---

class: my-one-page-font

# Monetary Policy and Stock Prices

Monetary policy can affect stock prices in two ways:

1. First, when the Fed lowers interest rates, the return on bonds declines,so
    - the required return, $k_e$, is likely to be somewhat higher:
      - lowers the denominator in the Gordon formula
      - raises stock prices.

2. Second, lowering of interest rates is likely to stimulate the economy, so
    - the growth rate in dividends, $g$, is likely to be somewhat higher.
      - lowers the denominator in the Gordon formula
      - raises stock prices.

# Recall

- The rate of return from holding a security equals the sum
  - of the capital gain on the security, 
  - any cash payments 
  - divided by the initial purchase price of the security.


$$R=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}+D_t}{P_{t}}$$

---

class: my-one-page-font

# The Theory of Rational Expectations 

- __Adaptive expectations:__
  - Expectations are formed from past experience only.
  - Changes in expectations will occur slowly 
    - as new information arrives.

- But: 
  1. People use more than just past data to form their expectations 
  2. People change their expectations quickly.

--

- __Rational expectations:__
  - Expectations = optimal forecasts using all available information.
      - does not mean the prediction is always perfectly accurate,
      - e.g. unaware of some relevant information.

- But: 
  - It takes too much effort to 
    1. obtain information
    2. make an expectation the best guess possible.
 

---

class: my-one-page-font

# The Theory of Rational Expectations 

- Rationale Behind the Theory in financial markets:

 - The incentives for equating expectations with optimal forecasts are especially strong
  - people with better forecasts of the future get rich.

- Efficient market hypothesis
  - Theory of rational expectations to financial markets 
  - Implications: 
    1. If there is a change in the behavior of a variable,
      - expectations of the variable   will change as well, e.g.
      - Changes in the conduct of monetary policy 
    2. The forecast errors of expectations will, on average, be zero and 
      - cannot be predicted ahead of time.

---

class: my-one-page-font

# Forming Expectations

  - At the beginning of the period, we know $P_{t}$ and $D_t$.  
  - $P_{t+1}$ is unknown and we must form an expectation of it. 

The expected return then is
$$R^{e}=\frac{P_{t+1}^{e}-P_{t}+D_t}{P_{t}}$$


- Expectations of future prices = optimal forecasts using available information:

$$P_{t+1}^{e}=P_{t+1}^{o f} \Rightarrow R^{e}=R^{of}$$

- But returns can not be far away from equilibrium returns: 

$$
R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}
$$

---

class: my-one-page-font

# The Efficient Market Hypothesis


Current prices are such that:
  - optimal forecast of a security’s return = the security’s equilibrium return.
  - a security’s price fully reflects all available information.
  - all unexploited profit opportunities will be eliminated

- Why does this imply $R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}$?

$$\begin{aligned}
&R^{\text {of }}>R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \uparrow \Rightarrow R^{o f} \downarrow \\
&R^{o f}<R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \downarrow \Rightarrow R^{o f} \uparrow
\end{aligned}$$

until

$$R^{o f}=R^{\star}$$

# Application

- How Valuable Are Published Reports by Investment Advisors?

> Information in newspapers and in the published reports of
investment advisers is readily available to many market
participants 

- What does that mean to you?

--

- This information is already reflected in market prices.
   - Acting on this information will not yield abnormally high returns, on average.
   - The empirical evidence for the most part confirms this.
   - Recommendations from investment advisors cannot help us outperform the market. Why?

- A hot tip is probably information already contained in the price of the stock.

class: my-one-page-font


# Application

- What Do Stock Market Crashes Tell Us About the EMH?

--

- Nothing in efficient markets theory rules out large changes in stock prices.
- A large change in stock prices can result
    1. from new information 
    2. declines in optimal forecasts of the future valuation of firms
      - factors other than market fundamentals may have an effect on asset prices.

--

- Why the EMH Does Not Imply That Financial Markets Are Efficient

> Some financial economists believe all prices are always
correct and reflect market fundamentals (items that
have a direct impact on future income streams of the
securities) and so financial markets are efficient.

- Hard to reconcile with the fact that prices in the stock market are very volatile.

# Behavioral Finance

- The lack of short selling (causing over-priced stocks) may be explained by loss aversion.

- The large trading volume may be explained by investor overconfidence.

- Stock market bubbles may be explained by overconfidence and social contagion

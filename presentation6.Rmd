# Common Stock

- __Common stock__ is the principal way that corporations raise equity capital. 
  - Stockholders has the right to sell the stock
  - For publicly listed firms, this happens in secondary markets

--

- __Shareholders__: owners of stock
  -  ownership interest usually proportional to percentage of outstanding shares owned.   
    - right to vote and residual claimant of cash flows
    
--

- Stockholders are usually paid with __dividends__. Dividends depend on 
  - the source of funds/ net earnings of the corporation
  - the use of  funds/debt repayment or new investments
 
--

- Dividends are  made periodically, usually quarterly.

# Price of Common Stock

- We use the One-Period Valuation Model:


$$P_{0}=\frac{\operatorname{Div}_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)}+\frac{P_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)}$$
- $P_{0},P_{1}=$ the current and future price of the stock
- $\operatorname{Div}_{1}=$ the dividend paid at the end of year 1
- $k_{e}=$ the required return on investment in equity

--

Required return on investment in equity:
  - alternative returns
  - depends on preferences towards risk
  - prior information


---

# The Generalized Dividend Valuation Model:

The value of stock today is the present value of all future cash flows
$$P_{0}=\frac{D_{1}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{1}}+\frac{D_{2}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{2}}+\ldots+\frac{D_{n}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{n}}+\frac{P_{n}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{n}}$$
--

- If $P_{n}$ is far in the future, it will not affect $P_{0}$!

$$P_{0}=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_{t}}{\left(1+k_{e}\right)^{t}}$$

--

The price of the stock is determined only by the __present value of the future dividend stream__!
  - present value depends on required return 
  - What would dividends be, in 5,10,20,100 years?

# The Gordon Growth Model

- Corporations try to increase the rate of dividends:

$$P_{0}=\frac{D_{0}(1+g)}{\left(k_{e}-g\right)}=\frac{D_{1}}{\left(k_{e}-g\right)}$$
- $D_{0}=$ the most recent dividend paid
- $k_{e}=$ the required return on an investment in equity

--

- $g=$ the expected constant growth rate in dividends
  - Dividends are assumed to continue growing at a constant rate forever
  - The growth rate is assumed to be less than the required return on equity

# Rate of Return

- The rate of return from holding a security equals   
  - the sum of the capital gain on the security, + 
  - any cash payments /
  - by the initial purchase price of the security.


$$R_{t,t+1}=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}$$
- $R=$ the rate of return on the security
- $P_{t+1}=$ price of the security at time $t+1$, the end of the holding period
- $P_{t}=$ price of the security at time $t$, the beginning of the holding period
- $C=$ cash payment (coupon or dividend) made during the holding period
  - for stocks, this is the dividend   

---

class: my-one-page-font

# Rate of Return

- Observe, we could do the same between $t$ and $t+n$

$$R_{t,t+n}=\frac{P_{t+n}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}$$
- $R=$ the rate of return on the security
- $P_{t+n}=$ price of the security at time $t+1$, the end of the holding period
- $P_{t}=$ price of the security at time $t$, the beginning of the holding period
- $C=$ cash payment (coupon or dividend) made during the holding period
  - for stocks, this is the dividends received in these n periods

# How the Market Sets Stock Prices  

- The price is set by the buyer willing to pay the highest price.
  - the buyer who can take best advantage of the asset.
  - the buyer with superior information about an asset 
  - more information can increase price by reducing perceived risk.

--

- Information is important for individuals to value each asset.
  - When new information is released about a firm, expectations and prices change.

--

- Market participants constantly receive information  
  - revise expectations
  - revise valuations
  - so stock prices change frequently.

# Price Earnings Valuation Method

- Theoretically, we want to use Dividend Valuation Method
  - Difficult to apply. Dividends are hard to predict 

    
--

- Price earnings(PE) ratio
  - Provides an alternative
  - Based on other similar firms price/earnings
  - Price of firm's stock = the average industry PE times the expected earnings per share.
  
$$\frac{P}{E} \times E=P$$
--

- PE ratio is  widely followed
  - how much will investors pay for $1 of earnings 
  - it is high when:
      1. market expects earnings to rise
      2. market feels earnings are very low risk

# The Coronavirus Stock

- Market Crash of 2020

>  The spread of the coronavirus in February 2020 triggered
a stock market crash in which the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell from a peak of 29,551 on February 12 to
18,561 on March 20, a decline of 37%.

--

- What caused the crash?

  - The combination of expectations of a lower dividend growth rate ($g$) +
  - a higher required return on investment in equity $\left(k_{e}\right)$

--

- Valuations during the Pandemic

# Monetary Policy and Stock Prices

Monetary policy can affect stock prices in two ways:

1. First, when the Fed lowers interest rates, the return on bonds declines,so
    - the required return, $k_e$, is likely to be somewhat higher:
      - lowers the denominator in the Gordon formula
      - raises stock prices.

2. Second, lowering of interest rates is likely to stimulate the economy, so
    - the growth rate in dividends, $g$, is likely to be somewhat higher.
      - lowers the denominator in the Gordon formula
      - raises stock prices.

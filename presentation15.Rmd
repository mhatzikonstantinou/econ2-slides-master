# What will you learn in this lecture?

--

-  Why is deflation a problem for economic policy makers?

--

-  Why can printing money lead to higher rates of inflation and hyperinflation?

--


-  How does the Phillips curve describe the short run trade off between inflation and unemployment?

--

-  Why does the trade off between inflation and unemployment cease in the long run?

--

-  Why can even moderate levels of inflation be hard to end?

- Most Central banks use either a version of the Taylor rule or inflation targeting.
]

- Recently, many CBs moved to inflation targeting
- The central bank sets an explicit target for the inflation rate.

# Hyperinflation

- Very high rates of inflation—in excess of 100 percent per year— are known as hyperinflation.

--

-  For example, when governments want to spend much more than they raise through taxes;
  - so they force their central bank to “buy” government bonds.
  -  Hyperinflation occurred in Zimbabwe during the 2000s, 
    - prices increased by (on average) 7500 percent per year.
    - Hyperinflation tends to be associated with slow growth, if not severe recession.

--

- __What caused 500 billion percent inflation in Zimbabwe(2008) and Germany (1922-1923)?__
  - High inflation is always associated with rapid increases in the money supply.

# Deflation

- But in the 1990s, deflation reappeared in Japan and proved difficult to reverse.
- __Debt deflation__ in Europe, low loan rate by banks, low spending, reduction in AD.
  
- Deflation
  - lenders gain, and borrowers lose.
  - Deflation reduces aggregate demand, deepening an economic slump. 
  
- With expected deflation, nominal interest rates fall.
  - There is a zero bound on the nominal interest rate: it cannot go below zero.
  - __Liquidity trap:__ the inability to use monetary policy because nominal interest rates are too low

- If money supply increases, AD increases and the economy moves to E2.
  - Higher prices drive nominal wages up, and the SRAS shifts to the left.

- The percentage increase in the price level from P1 to P3 equals the percentage increase in the money supply.
- Changes in money supply have no effect on real GDP–money is neutral.  

]

--

- The classical model assumes the economy moves directly from E1 to E3.

???
This is a poor assumption when inflation is low because wages are sticky. But it’s good assumption when inflation is high because the stickiness of wages vanish. Result: In countries with high inflation, changes in money supply are quickly translated into changes in inflation.

#  The quantity theory of money

- Beginning in the sixteenth century, Spain sent gold and silver from Mexico and Peru back to Europe. 
  - These metals were minted into coins, increasing the money supply.
  - Prices in Europe rose steadily during those years.

- This helped people to make the connection between the amount of money in circulation, and the price level.

--

- In the early twentieth century, Irving Fisher formalized the relationship between money and prices as the quantity equation:

$$M \times V=P \times Y$$

- $M:\text {  Money supply}$, $P:\text {  Price level}$, 
- $Y:\text {  Real output}$, $V:\text { Velocity of money.}$

???
the average number of times each dollar  in the money supply is used to purchase goods and services included in GDP.}}$

# Calculating the velocity of money

Measuring:

- The money supply ( $M$ ) with M1+M2

- The price level ( $P$ ) with the GDP deflator, and

- The level of real output ( $Y$ ) with real GDP.

--

We obtain the following value for velocity:

$$
V=\frac{P \times Y}{M}
$$

$$
V=\frac{1.09 \times \$ 16.0 \text { trillion }}{2.8 \text { trillion }}=6.2
$$

- We can always calculate $V$. But will we always get the same answer?

# The quantity theory of money and inflation

- The quantity theory of money asserts that, subject to measurement error, we will!

$$M \times V=P \times Y$$
--

$$\ln M + \ln V= \ln P + \ln Y$$

--

Expressing the equation of exchange in growth rates:
$$
\% \Delta M +\% \Delta V= \% \Delta P+ \% \Delta Y
$$

--

- In the long run, velocity does not change, so
$$
\% \Delta P = \% \Delta M - \% \Delta Y
$$
Inflation rate = Growth Rate of Money Supply − Growth Rate of Real GDP

# The inflation tax


- What is to prevent a government from paying for its expenses by printing money? 

--


- The Treasury issues debt, and the Fed monetizes it by buying it back from the public through open-market purchases of Treasury bills. 
- The U.S. government can and does raise revenue by printing money.

--

__Seignorage:__ the revenue generated by a government’s right to print money.
  - By printing money, a government increases the money supply, which triggers inflation. 
  - Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money.
  - __The inflation tax:__ the reduction in the real value of money held by the public caused by inflation

---

class: my-one-page-font

# Seignorage

$$\text{Seignorage} = ΔM$$


$$\text{Real seignorage} = ΔM/P$$
$$\text{Real seignorage}  = (ΔM/M) × (M/P) $$

- In the face of high inflation the public reduces the real amount of money it holds, 
  - so M/P gets smaller. 
- The government responds by accelerating the rate of growth of the money supply, 
  - ∆M/M increasing inflation. 
- This leads to a self-reinforcing process can easily spiral out of control.

???
Real seignorage = rate of growth of the money supply × real money supply.

# The output gap and the unemployment rate

- The aggregate output fluctuates around potential output in the short run: 
  - When aggregate output falls short of potential output, a recessionary gap arises;
  - When aggregate output exceeds potential output, an inflationary gap arises.
- The output gap: the percentage difference between the actual level of real GDP and potential output.
  - When the output gap is positive (an inflationary gap), the unemployment rate is below the natural rate.
  - When the output gap is negative (a recessionary gap), the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.

- Fluctuations of aggregate output around the long-run potential output correspond to fluctuations of the unemployment around the natural rate.

# Okun's Law

- Cyclical unemployment seems to move less than the output gap.
  - In 1982, for example, the output gap reached −8%, but cyclical unemployment reached only 4%.
  - Arthur Okun, John F. Kennedy’s chief economic adviser, discovered this.

__Okun’s law:__ 
  - There is a predictable negative relationship between the output gap and the unemployment rate. 
  - Modern estimates find that a rise in the output gap of 1% reduces the unemployment rate by about 0.5%.
  
  
__Example:__ If the natural rate of unemployment is 5.2% and the economy is producing at 98% of potential output (the output gap is −2%), then Okun’s law predicts an unemployment rate of 

$$5.2\% − 0.5 × (−2\%) = 6.2\%.$$

# What can shift the short-run Phillips Curve

- A negative/positive supply shock shifts SRPC up/down 
  - as the inflation rate increases/falls for every level of the unemployment rate.
- An increase in expected inflation shifts the short-run Phillips curve up.

???
The expected inflation rate 
It’s the rate of inflation that employers and workers expect in the near future. 
The expected inflation rate is the most important factor, other than the unemployment rate, affecting inflation.

# Unemployment and inflation in the Long run


- An attempt to reduce unemployment leads to accelerating inflation.
- To avoid accelerating inflation over time, the unemployment rate must be high enough that the actual rate of inflation matches the expected rate of inflation. 
- The natural rate hypothesis: the relationship between accelerating inflation and the unemployment rate
- The nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, is the unemployment rate at which inflation does not change over time.
- The vertical line LRPC is the long-run Phillips curve, the relationship between unemployment and inflation in the long run, after inflation expectations adjusted to experience. 
- It is vertical because any unemployment rate below the NAIRU leads to ever-accelerating inflation. 
- An unemployment rate below the NAIRU cannot be maintained in the long run.

- Disinflation is the process of bringing down inflation that is embedded in expectations.
  -Once inflation has become embedded in peoples’ expectations, reducing it can be difficult.
  - Disinflation can require a recession.

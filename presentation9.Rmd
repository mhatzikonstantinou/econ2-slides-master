the long run.

exchange market and interpret the equilibrium in the market
for foreign exchange.

# Foreign Exchange Market (1 of 2)

Exchange rate: price of one currency in terms of another

Foreign exchange market: the financial market where
exchange rates are determined

Spot transaction: immediate (two-day) exchange of
bank deposits

Spot exchange rate

Forward transaction: the exchange of bank deposits at
some specified future date

Forward exchange rate

# Foreign Exchange Market 
Appreciation: a currency rises in value relative to another
currency

Depreciation: a currency falls in value relative to another
currency

When a country’s currency appreciates, the country’s goods
become more expensive to foreigners and foreign goods in
that country become less expensive to domestic economic
agents

The foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter market
wherein most trades involve the buying and selling of bank
deposits denominated in different currencies

# Exchange Rates in the Long Run

Theory of Purchasing Power Parity assumptions:

All goods are identical in both countries

Trade barriers and transportation costs are low

Many goods and services are not traded across
borders

# Factors That Affect Exchange Rates in the Long Run

| Factor | Change in Factor | Response of the Exchange Rate, E^(**) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Domestic price level † | uarr | darr |
| Trade barriers † | uarr | uarr |
| Import demand | uarr | darr |
| Export demand | uarr | uarr |
| Productivity † | uarr | uarr |

*Units of foreign currency per dollar:

indicates domestic currency appreciation;

depreciation.

Relative to other countries.

Note: Only increases

in the factors are shown; the effects of decreases in the variables on the exchange rate are the

opposite of those indicated in the “Response” column.

# Exchange Rates in the Short Run

An exchange rate is the price of domestic assets in terms of foreign assets

Supply curve for domestic assets

Assume amount of domestic assets is fixed (supply curve
is vertical)

Demand curve for domestic assets

Most important determinant is the relative expected return
of domestic assets

At lower current values of the dollar (everything else
equal), the quantity demanded of dollar assets is higher

# Shifts in the demand for domestic assets

Domestic interest rate

Foreign interest rate

Expected future exchange rate

# Factors affecting the interest rate 

| Factor | Change in Factor | Assets at Each Exchange Rate | Response of Exchange Rate, E |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Domestic interest rate| uarr | uarr | uarr |
| Foreign interest rate |  |  |  |
|Expected domestic price level||||
|Expected trade barriers||||
|Expected import demand||||
|Expected export demand||||

# Changes in Interest Rates and the Exchange Rate

Changes in Interest Rates

When domestic real interest rates raise, the
domestic currency appreciates.

When domestic interest rates rise due to an
expected increase in inflation, the domestic
currency depreciates.

Changes in the Money Supply

A higher domestic money supply causes the
domestic currency to depreciate.

Effect of a Rise in the Domestic Interest Rate
as a Result of an Increase in Expected Inflation

Step 1. A rise in the domestic real interest as a result of an increase in expected inflation shifts the demand curve to the left...

Step 2.this leads to a fall in the exchange rate

# Applications

Application: The Global Financial Crisis
and the Dollar

With the start of the global financial crisis in August
2007, the dollar began an accelerated decline in value,
falling by 9% against the euro until mid-July of 2008.
After hitting an all-time low against the euro on July 11,
the value of the dollar suddenly shot upward, by over
20% against the euro by the end of October. What is
the relationship between the global financial crisis and
these large swings in the value of the dollar?


Application: Brexit and the British Pound

As noted in the introduction, the Brexit vote in the
United Kingdom on June 23, 2016, led to nearly a 10%
depreciation in the British pound, from $1.48 to the
pound on June 23, just before the vote, to $1.36 per
pound on June 24. What explains the large one-day
decline in the exchange rate for the pound?

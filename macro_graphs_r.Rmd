## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(econocharts)
supply(ncurves = 1,            # Number of supply curves to be plotted
       type = "convex",        # Type of the curve ("line" or "convex")
       x = c(3, 5, 6),         # Y-axis values where to create intersections
       linecol = 4,            # Color of the curves
       generic = TRUE,         # Intersection labels are in a generic form (X_A, Y_A)
       geom = "label",         # Label type of the intersection points
       geomfill = "lightblue", # If geom = "label", is the background color of the label
       main = "Supply curve")  # Title of the plot
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Add custom curves
supply1 <- data.frame(Hmisc::bezier(c(1, 3, 9),
                                    c(9, 3, 1))) 

supply2 <- data.frame(Hmisc::bezier(c(2.5, 4.5, 10.5),
                                    c(10.5, 4.5, 2.5))) 

demand1 <- data.frame(Hmisc::bezier(c(1, 8, 9),
                                    c(1, 5, 9))) 


# Custom data
supply1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 9), y = c(1, 9))
supply1

demand1 <- data.frame(x = c(7, 2), y = c(2, 7))
demand1

supply2 <- data.frame(x = c(2, 10), y = c(1, 9))
supply2

lrsupply <- data.frame(x = c(4.5, 4.5), y = c(0, 10))

demand2 <- data.frame(x = c(8, 2), y = c(2, 8))
demand2

p <- sdcurve(supply1,   # Custom data
             demand1,
             supply2, 
             demand2,lrsupply, curve_names = T,names = c("AS_1","AD1","SRAS","AD2","LRAS"),
             main = "Recessionary Gap",
             equilibrium = TRUE) # Background color
p + annotate("segment", x = 2.5, xend = 3, y = 6.5, yend = 7,                # Add more layers
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "lines")), colour = "grey50")
p
# Supply and demand curves and arrows
sdcurve(supply1, demand1, supply2, demand1,
        names = c("D[1]", "S[1]","D[2]", "S[1]")) +
  annotate("segment", x = 2.5, xend = 3.5, y = 7, yend = 7, # Add arrows
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "lines")), colour = "grey50") +
  annotate("segment", x = 1, xend = 1, y = 3.5, yend = 4.5,               
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "lines")), colour = "grey50") +
  annotate("segment", x = 5, xend = 6, y = 1, yend = 1,               
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "lines")), colour = "grey50")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

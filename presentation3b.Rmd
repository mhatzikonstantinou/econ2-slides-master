# How we measure the aggregate economy?

- NIPA and the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts
  - __GDP__: Expenditure equals output equals incomes 
  - Savings = Investment 
  - Household capital (directly owned houses and durable goods) 
  - Business capital (business are owned by households through intermediaries) 
  - Wealth

- Every sector saves/invests
- Domestic Investment $\neq$ Domestic Savings

# Relative Valuation Metrics

  - Price Earnings Ratio (Relative Valuation to Sector)
    - Value relative to GDP/Profits
  - Tobin's Q (Replacement Value of Capital Stock)

--

- Can you forecast returns with these metrics?

--

- Why?
  - The Total Value of US Corporations Has Risen over Time
  - But so did GDP?
  - Is the stock market overvalued?

# Stock Market Value Relative to GDP

- The Buffet Indicator: Corporate equities to GDP
  - __Numerator:__ Corporate Equities; Liability from the Federal Reserve's Quarterly Z.1 Balance Sheet (B.103).  
      - This series is also published in the FRED repository as NCBEILQ027S.
  - __Denominator:__ Nominal Quarterly GDP

- Do you think this is a good measure?

# Tobin’s Q

- Cost Approach to Valuation of the US Non-Financial Corporate Sector from Balance Sheet

- Financial Accounts of the United States Table B103 
- Assets measured using 
- Replacement Value 
- Historical Cost 
- Equity Measured 
- Book Value 
- Market Value

--

Balance Sheet Metrics
• Tobin’s Q 
• Market Value of Equity divided by Replacement 
Value of Assets 
• Book to Market Ratio 
• Market Value of Equity divided by Historical Cost 
of Assets 
• Inflation reduces historical cost of assets relative to 
replacement cost



---

# Tobin’s Q

 Financial Accounts Table B.103 
• Ratio of Market Value of Corporate Equities 
• to Net Worth 
• Net Worth is 
• Non-Financial Assets at Replacement Value 
• Plus Financial Assets 
• Minus Liabilities

The Q Ratio is based on data from the Federal Reserve Z.1 Statistical Release, section B.103 Balance Sheet of Nonfarm NonfinancialCorporate Business. Specifically it is the ratio of Corporate Equities; Liability divided by Corporate Business; Net Worth. Data estimates before 1945 were provided by John Mihaljevic, Dr. Tobin's research assistant at Yale.

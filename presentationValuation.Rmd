# Valuing the Aggregate Economy


Three ways to value a Stock Index
  - Replacement Cost
  - Price/Earnings
  - Discounted Dividends
  
--

Benchmarks for Economy 
  - Earnings = Profits 
  - Dividends = Cash flows to households
  - Balance Sheets = Assets owned by households
  
--

- Why?
  - The Total Value of US Corporations Has Risen over Time
  - But so did GDP? Is the stock market overvalued?

# How we measure the aggregate economy?

- NIPA and the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts
  - __GDP__: Expenditure equals output equals incomes 
  - Savings = Investment 
  - Household capital (directly owned houses and durable goods) 
  - Business capital (business are owned by households through intermediaries) 
  - Wealth of domestic households

# Tobin’s Q

- __Market Value of Equity divided by Replacement Value of Assets__
    - __Market Value of Equity divided by Historical Cost of Assets__
    - Inflation reduces historical cost relative to  replacement cost

- Cost Approach
  - Value the US Non-Financial Corporate Sector 
  - Balance Sheet of the Economy

--

- Financial Accounts of the United States
    - Table B103 
    - Assets measured using  Replacement Value (Historical Cost)

- Equity can be measured using
    - Book Value 
    - Market Value


---

#Table B.103 

- Ratio of Market Value of Corporate Equities to Net Worth 

- Net Worth is 
  - Non-Financial Assets at Replacement Value 
  - Plus Financial Assets 
  - Minus Liabilities

The Q Ratio is based on data from the Federal Reserve Z.1 Statistical Release, section B.103 Balance Sheet of Nonfarm NonfinancialCorporate Business. Specifically it is the ratio of Corporate Equities; Liability divided by Corporate Business; Net Worth. Data estimates before 1945 were provided by John Mihaljevic, Dr. Tobin's research assistant at Yale.

Sri Lanka Twin Deficits

"Countries with high debt levels and limited policy space will face additional strains. Look no further than Sri Lanka as a warning sign," said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Saturday.

She said developing nations had also been experiencing sustained capital outflows for four months in a row, putting their dreams of catching up with advanced economies at risk.


Over the years, Sri Lanka had built up a huge amount of debt - last month, it became the first country in the Asia Pacific region in 20 years to default on foreign debt.


China has been a dominant lender to several of these developing nations and therefore could control their destinies in crucial ways. But it's largely unclear what Beijing's lending conditions have been, or how it may restructure the debt.

Where China is at fault, according to Alan Keenan from International Crisis Group, is in encouraging and supporting expensive infrastructure projects that have not produced major economic returns.

"Equally important has been their active political support for the ruling Rajapaksa family and its policies... These political failures are at the heart of Sri Lanka's economic collapse, and until they are remedied through constitutional change and a more democratic political culture, Sri Lanka is unlikely to escape its current nightmare."

Worryingly, other countries appear to be on a similar trajectory.

However, as the crisis unfolded, it became clear that the strong growth record of these economies had masked important vulnerabilities. In particular, years of rapid domestic credit growth and inadequate supervisory oversight had resulted in a significant build-up of financial leverage and doubtful loans. 
Overheating domestic economies and real estate markets added to the risks and led to increased reliance on foreign savings, 
reflected in mounting current account deficits and a build-up in external debt. Heavy foreign borrowing, often at short maturities, 
also exposed corporations and banks to significant exchange rate and funding risks—risks that had been masked by longstanding currency pegs. 
When the pegs proved unsustainable, firms saw sharp increases in the local currency value of their external debts, leading many into distress 
and even insolvency


In response to the spreading crisis, the international community mobilized large loans totaling $118 billion for Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea, and took other actions to stabilize the most affected countries. Financial support came from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and governments in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and the United States. The basic strategy was to help the crisis countries rebuild official reserve cushions, and buy time for policy adjustments to restore confidence and stabilize economies, while also minimizing lasting disruption to countries’ relations with their external creditors.

To address the structural weaknesses exposed by the crisis, aid was contingent on substantial domestic policy reforms. The mix of policies varied by country, but generally included measures to deleverage, clean up and strengthen weak financial systems, and to improve the competitiveness and flexibility of their economies. On the macro side, countries hiked interest rates to help stabilize currencies and tightened fiscal policy to speed external adjustment and cover the cost of bank clean-ups. However, over time, as markets began to stabilize, the macro policy mix evolved to include some loosening of fiscal and interest rate policy to support growth. 

The Federal Reserve played an active role in informing and supporting the U.S. and global policy responses. Behind the scenes, the Federal Reserve provided timely analysis of the underlying adjustment challenges and closely monitored the risks the crisis posed to U.S. banks, and the condition and funding profiles of Asian bank offices in the United States, coordinating policy with other bank supervisors in the United States and internationally. The Fed also acted as an agent for the U.S. Treasury, including by helping arrange a bridge loan for Thailand in the early stages of the crisis.

Perhaps most visibly, the Federal Reserve played a catalytic role in an official sector effort to encourage banks to act in their collective self interest in helping South Korea avoid a disorderly default.  Following a meeting on December 24, 1997, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. banks with the largest exposures to South Korean banks voluntarily committed to roll over their short-term loans, and to work with South Korean authorities to restructure them into medium-term loans. Similar meetings and other forms of outreach took place in other G-10 countries. In the ensuing months, the Federal Reserve and other central banks oversaw banks’ cooperation with their rollover commitments, pending completion of the restructuring in April 1998.

The combination of strong policy measures by the affected countries and external support from the international community ultimately contained the crisis and set the stage for a subsequent strong recovery.

For the United States, the adverse direct trade impact resulting from the Asian crisis proved manageable, and was partly offset by some other more positive spillovers, including reduced inflation pressures (from cheaper Asian imports and weaker global commodity prices) and lower bond yields (from a flight to dollar assets). The adverse fallout for some other countries was more substantial. In particular, a number of emerging market economies in Latin America and Eastern Europe, including Brazil and Russia, faced significant balance-of-payments pressures in 1998, reflecting spillovers from the Asia crisis as well as home grown vulnerabilities, some of which were quite different from those at the heart of Asia’s crisis.

# What will you learn today?


- _What is gross domestic product (GDP), and how is it calculated?_

--

- __What is the difference between real GDP and nominal GDP, and why is real GDP the appropriate measure of real economic activity?__

 - Prices of goods and services are different when we study the same economy in different time periods,
  
  - Real GDP adjusts for the different Price Level


--

- __What is a price index, and how is it used to calculate the inflation rate?__

 - Measures cost of the "same basket of goods" in different years. 
 
--

**Why?**

- From  **International Monetary Fund** data: In 2017–2018, the nominal GDP of Venezuela grew from 2 to 2,039 billion in national currency–a 101,850% increase.At the same time, there are food riots in the country. 

- From  **Bureau of Economic Analysis** data: In 2000, the value of output produced by the soft drink industry was $3.3 billion. In 2006, that number was $4.1 billion $\rightarrow$ the United States’ GDP increased by $800 million as a result of soft drink production.

# Nominal GDP and Real GDP

- Nominal GDP is the value of goods and services produced during a given year **valued at the prices of that year**.
--


- Real GDP is the value of final goods and services produced in a given year **valued at the prices of a reference base year**.
--

- The current base year is 2012: **"Real GDP shows what GDP would have been in each year if goods were priced in 2012 dollars."**

__Calculating nominal GDP__

- Table 4.3 (a) shows the quantities produced and the prices in 2009 (the base year) and in 2014. 

- Nominal GDP in 2009 is $100 million.

- Because 2009 is the base year, real GDP equals nominal GDP and is $100 million.

- Nominal GDP in 2014 is three times its value in 2009.

If we add up consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases, exports and subtract imports, we will get the market value of the goods and services the economy produces—the country’s gross domestic product.

.pull-right[

- Let's calculate real GDP in 2014.


- The quantities are those of
2014, as in part (b).


- The prices are those in the
base year (2009) 


- The sum of these
expenditures is real GDP
in 2014, which is $160
million

# GDP Statistics

- How is GDP usually presented?

--

```{r  out.width = "50%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week3graphs/gdpstats.png") 
```

- **What is the base year?**

--

- Where is the deflator?
???
Except for the base year, real GDP (output at prices of a base year) is not the same as nominal GDP (output at current prices).


--

-  Does Real GDP = Welfare/Standard of Living?

???
China: 14.72 trillion USD (2020) vs France 2.603 trillion USD(2020)
Not an end in itself as it does not address how a country uses that output to affect living standards.

# GDP and the meaning of life


$$
\text { Real GDP Per capita  }=\frac{\text { Real GDP }}{\text { Population }}
$$


--

__Uses and limitations of real GDP__

- Measure The Standard of Living Over Time
- Real GDP per person tells us the value of goods and services that the **average person** can enjoy.


--

- For example, in the U.S. in 1960, real GDP per person was $15,850$ $ and in 2012 , it was $42,800$ $.
- So real GDP per person in 2012 was $2.7$ times its 1960 level.

--

__Some Shortcomings:__

- Nonmarket activities and Leisure
- Improved product quality
- GDP and the environment
- Noneconomic sources of well being

[The Economist, Growth does not mean happiness](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/03/21/economic-growth-does-not-guarantee-rising-happiness)


???
By using real GDP, we remove any influence that rising prices and a rising cost of living might have had on our comparison. 
HOUSEWORK AND CHILDCARE
Distributional Macroeconomics
GDP can also be a poor measure of the living standards in
various nations.
To get around the problem, economists use purchasing power
parity (PPP) PPP),

# Aggregate Price Indeces

- __Aggregate price level:__ a measure of the overall level of prices in the economy

- To measure the aggregate price level, economists calculate the cost of purchasing a market basket.

- **Market basket:** a hypothetical set of consumer purchases
of goods and services

--

__Price index:__ the cost of purchasing a given market basket
in a given year, where that cost is normalized so that it is
equal to 100 in the selected base year

--
$$
\text{Price index in a given year} = 
$$


$$
\frac{\text{Cost of market basket in a given year}}{\text{Cost of market basket in base year}}\times 100
$$


---

# Calculating the cost of a market basket

|  | January | February |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Price of orange | $$ \$ 0.20 $$ | $$ \$ 0.40 $$ |
| Price of grapefruit | $$ \$ 0.60 $$ | $$ \$ 1.00 $$ |
| Price of lemon | $$ \$ 0.25 $$ | $$ \$ 0.45 $$ |
| Cost of market basket (200 oranges, 50 grapefruit, 100 lemons ) | $$(200 \times 0.20) + (50 \times 0.60)+ (100 \times 0.25) = \$95.00 $$| $$ = \$175.00 $$ |

--

- The CPI in the USA measures the cost of the market basket of a typical urban American family

--
- __The inflation rate:__ the yearly percentage change in a price
index, typically based on consumer price index (CPI), the
most common measure of the aggregate price level.

--





$$
\textbf{Inflation rate: } \frac{\text{Price index in year 2 - Price index in year 1}}{\text{Price index in year 1}}\times 100
$$

- __CPI__: Based on consumption basket and prices consumers pay!

- __Producer price index (PPI):__ similar to the CPI, but measures changes in the prices of goods purchased by producers

- Economists also use the GDP deflator that measures the price level by calculating the ratio of nominal to real GDP.


$$
\text { GDP deflator }=100 \times \frac{\text { Nominal GDP }}{\text { Real GDP }}

- Compute nominal GDP in each year.

- Compute real GDP in each year using 2012 as the base year.

--

- nominal GDP multiply Ps and Qs from same year

  - 2012: $$ \$ 46,200= \$30 \times 900+ \$ 100 \times 192$$

--

- Compute real GDP in each year using 2012 as the base year.



--

real GDP multiply each year's Qs by 2012 Ps

  - 2012: $46,200

--

- 2014: $$ \$ 52,000=\$ 30 \times 1050+\$ 100 \times 205 $$

# Practice Problem: Inflation


- Use your previous answers to compute the GDP deflator in each
year.
- Use GDP deflator to compute the inflation rate from 2012 to
2013, and from 2013 to 2014.

--


|  | Nom. GDP | Real GDP | GDP deflator | Inflation rate |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2012 | $46,200 | $46,200 | 100.0 | n.a. |
| 2013 | 51,400 | 50,000 | 102.8 | 2.8% |
| 2014 | 58,300 | 52,000 | 112.1 | 9.1% |


--

* GDP deflator $(2008)=100 \times \frac{51,400}{50000}=102.8$

--

* Inflation rate $(2008)= \frac{102.8 - 100}{100} = 0.028$

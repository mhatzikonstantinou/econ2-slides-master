# What will you learn in this lecture?

- What is the importance of the multiplier? 


--

- What is the aggregate consumption function? 


--

- How do expected future income and aggregate wealth  affect consumer spending?

--

- What determines investment spending, and why do we need to distinguish between planned investment spending and unplanned inventory investment?

--

- Why is investment spending considered a leading  indicator of the future state of the economy?

- Small yet powerful: Although much smaller than consumer spending, investment spending tends  to drive the booms and busts in the business cycle. 


- __Planned investment spending:__ the investment spending that businesses intend to undertake during a given period. Depends on:
1. Interest rate
2. Expected future real GDP
3. Current level of production capacity

# The effect of interest rates and capacity

- Firms with investment spending projects will only go ahead with a project if they expect a rate of return higher than the cost of the project. 

- If the interest rate rises, fewer projects will pass that test, and as a result investment spending will be lower. 

- Conversely, a fall in the interest rate makes some investment projects profitable so that more projects will be funded.

--

- If a firm has extra capacity and doesn’t expect sales to increase, its investment will be lower.

- Other things equal, the higher the current capacity, the lower the investment spending.

# Future GDP and investment spending

According to the accelerator principle: 
- A higher rate of growth in real GDP leads to higher planned investment spending.
- A lower growth rate of real GDP leads to lower planned investment spending.

--

- __Inventories:__ stocks of goods held to satisfy future sales
- __Inventory investment:__ the value of the change in total inventories held in the economy during a given period
- __Unplanned inventory investment:__ unplanned changes in inventories that occur when actual sales are more or less than businesses expected

--

???
If a firm pays for projects out of retained earnings (past profits used to finance investment spending), the trade-off is the same because the firm must consider the opportunity cost of the funds.

# The income-expenditure model


__Actual investment spending:__ the sum of planned investment spending and unplanned inventory investment
So, in any period:    

$$I = I_{Unplanned} + I_{Planned}$$

--

- We’ll see that the multiple rounds of changes in real GDP are accomplished through 
  - changes in the amount of output produced by firms
  - changes they make in response to changes in inventories.

# The income-expenditure model

Recall the assumptions underling the multiplier process:
1. Changes in overall spending lead to changes in aggregate output.
2. The interest rate is fixed.
3. Taxes, government transfers, and government purchases are all zero.
4. Exports and imports are both zero.

--

Since we assume that there are no taxes or transfers,
$$
\begin{aligned}
& YD  = G D P=C+I \text { and }
C=A+M P C \times Y D
\end{aligned}
$$

- If $I_{planned}$ is fixed and $A E_{Planned}$ the planned aggregate spending, so
$$A E_{Planned }=C+I_{Planned }$$

---

# Planned aggregate spending and real GDP

- __Example: If C = 300 + 0.6 × YD__


| Real GDP (billions of dollars) | YD (billions of dollars) | C (billions of dollars) | $I_{Planned}$ (billions of dollars) | $AE_{Planned}$ (billions of dollars) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $0 | $0 | $300 | $500 | $800 |
| 500 | 500 | 600 | 500 | 1,100 |
| 1,000 | 1,000 | 900 | 500 | 1,400 |
| 1,500 | 1,500 | 1,200 | 500 | 1,700 |

# Income Expenditure equilibrium

-  The __income–expenditure equilibrium__: no unplanned inventory investment


| Real GDP | $AE_{Planned}$ | $I_{Unplanned}$ |
| ---: | :---: | ---: |
| $0 | $800 | -$800 |
| 500 | 1,100 | -600 |
| 1,000 | 1,400 | -400 |
| 1,500 | 1,700 | -200 |
| 2,000 | 2,000 | 0 |
| 2,500 | 2,300 | 200 |
| 3,000 | 2,600 | 400 |
| 3,500 | 2,900 | 600 |

- If firms overestimate sales and produce too much, there will be unintended additions to inventories, $I_{Unplanned}>0$

- If firms underestimate sales and produce too little, there will be unintended additions to inventories, $I_{Unplanned}<0$

# Income expenditure equilibrium

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { GDP } &=C+I =C+I_{\text {Planned }}+I_{\text {Unplanned }}  \\
&=A E_{\text {Planned }}+I_{\text {Unplanned }}
\end{aligned}
$$
- Whenever real GDP exceeds $A E_{\text {Planned }}, I_{\text {Unplanned }}$ is positive.

- Whenever real GDP is less than $A E_{\text {Planned, }} I_{\text {Unplanned }}$ is negative.

> Firms will act to correct their mistakes. They change their output to eliminate the unanticipated changes in inventories and move the economy where real GDP = planned aggregate spending.

--

- Income–expenditure equilibrium GDP (Y*): the level of real GDP at which real GDP equals planned aggregate spending.

???
- The economy is in income–expenditure equilibrium when aggregate output (real GDP) is equal to planned aggregate spending.

# The multiplier and inventory adjustment

What happens when there’s a shift of the planned aggregate spending line? 


--

 - In our simple model, there are only two possible sources of a shift of the planned aggregate spending line: 
    - a change in planned investment spending, IPlanned,  
    - a shift of the aggregate consumption function, CF. 
--
    - A change in IPlanned can occur because of a change in the interest rate. 
    - A shift of the aggregate consumption function can occur because of a change in aggregate wealth—say, due to a rise in house prices.

# The multiplier and inventory adjustment

- Autonomous spending $\uparrow$ by 400 (MPC = 0.6)

| Real GDP | $AE_{Planned}$ before autonomous change | $AE_{Planned}$ after autonomous change |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 800 | 1,200 |
| 500 | 1,100 | 1,500 |
| 1,000 | 1,400 | 1,800 |
| 1,500 | 1,700 | 2,100 |

# The multiplier and inventory adjustment

| Real GDP | $AE_{Planned}$ before autonomous change | $AE_{Planned}$ after autonomous change |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 800 | 1,200 |
| 500 | 1,100 | 1,500 |
| 1,000 | 1,400 | 1,800 |
| 1,500 | 1,700 | 2,100 |
| 2,000 | 2,000 | 2,400 |
| 2,500 | 2,300 | 2,700 |
| 3,000 | 2,600 | 3,000 |
| 3,500 | 2,900 | 3,300 |
| 4,000 | 3,200 | 3,600 |

--

- When planned spending does not equal the aggregate output, this difference shows up in changes in inventories. 
- Firms respond to inventory changes and move real GDP to Income–expenditure equilibrium GDP.
- That’s why changes in inventories are a leading indicator of future economic activity.

$$\Delta Y^{*}=\text { Multiplier } \times \Delta A A E_{\text {Planned }}=\frac{1}{1-M P C} \times \Delta A A E_{\text {Planned }}$$

???
We can summarize these results in an equation, where ∆AAEPlanned represents the autonomous change in AEPlanned, and ΔY*=Y*2 – Y*1, the subsequent change in income–expenditure equilibrium GDP:
Since MPC < 1, each round of increases in disposable income leaks out into savings. As a result, increases in real GDP diminish from one round to the next. At some point the increase in real GDP is negligible, and the economy converges to a new income–expenditure equilibrium GDP.

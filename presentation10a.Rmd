# What will you learn in this lecture?

- What is the importance of the multiplier? 


--

- What is the aggregate consumption function? 


--

- How do expected future income and aggregate wealth  affect consumer spending?

--

- What determines investment spending, and why do we need to distinguish between planned investment spending and unplanned inventory investment?

--

- Why is investment spending considered a leading  indicator of the future state of the economy?

# The Multiplier: an informal introduction 

-  Rise or fall in aggregate spending leads to changes in income, 
  - which lead to further changes in aggregate spending. 
  - Let’s examine that chain reaction more closely. 

--

Four simplifying assumptions: 
  1. Producers are willing to supply additional output at a fixed price.
  2. Changes in aggregate spending translate into  changes in aggregate output (NOT PRICES)
  3. We take the interest rate as given.
  4. There is no government spending, no taxes and  no Exports and imports.

# The Multiplier: an informal introduction 


__Example:__ Suppose home builders spend an extra 100 billion on home construction: 
  - Aggregate output will increase by 100 billion. 

1. leads to increased profits and wages that flow to households, 
2. leads to increased consumer spending, which,
3. leads to increased  output yet again. 

--

- There are multiple rounds of increases in aggregate output. 

- How large is the total effect on aggregate output if we sum the effect from all these rounds of spending increases? 

???
Since households and firms are mutually
interdependent (recall the circular flow), booms
and busts involve chain reactions
The multiplier helps us understand the extent of the
chain reactions

# The Multiplier: an informal introduction 

__Marginal Propensity to Consume, or MPC__: the increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1.

$$ M P C=\frac{\Delta \text { consumer spending }}{\Delta \text { disposable income }}$$

--

For example, if consumer spending goes up by $6 and disposable income goes up by $10, MPC = $6/10 = 0.6

--

- Marginal propensity to save, or MPS: the fraction of an additional dollar of disposable income that is saved.

$$MPS = 1 − MPC \text{ (Whatever is not spent is saved)} $$

__Example continued:__ 
  1. The $ 100 billion increase in investment spending raises real GDP by 100 billion.
  2. a second-round increase in real GDP: $M P C \times  100$ billion.
  3.  a third-round increase in real GDP: $M P C \times M P C \times  100$ billion.
  4. ...
  5.  After an infinite number of rounds, the total effect on real GDP:
$$\left(1+M P C+M P C^{2}+M P C^{3}+\ldots\right) \times  100 = \frac{1}{1-M P C} \times  100$$

???
Mathematical fact:
$1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-x}$ if $x$ is between 0 and 1 .
Total increase in real GDP from a $\$ 100$ billion rise is

# The multiplier

- It’s important to distinguish between the initial change and the additional change in aggregate spending as the chain reaction unfolds. 
- An initial change in spending at a given level of real GDP is called an __autonomous change in aggregate spending__. 
  - the multiplier is the ratio of the total change in real GDP to the autonomous change in aggregate spending 
--

- If ΔAAS is an autonomous change in aggregate spending and ΔY = change in real GDP,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Delta Y=\frac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}} \times \Delta \mathrm{AAS} \\ \text { And the multiplier }=\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta \mathrm{AAS}}=\frac{1}{1-\mathrm{MPC}}\end{array}
$$
Let $\mathrm{MPC}=0.8$ and $\Delta \mathrm{AAS}=100$ Multiplier $=\frac{1}{1-0.8}=5$

# Current disposable income and consumer spending

- Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total spending on final goods and services. 

- But what determines how much consumers spend? The most important factor is __current disposable income.__

--

- Current disposable income: income after taxes are paid and government transfers are received

# The consumption function

__Consumption function:__ how an individual household’s consumer spending varies with the household’s disposable income:

$$ c=a+M P C \times y d$$

 - $c=$ household's consumer spending
 - $y d=$ household disposable income
 - $M P C=$ marginal propensity to consume
 - $a=$ what a family would spend even with zero income

# The aggregate consumption function


- __Aggregate consumption function:__ the relationship for the economy as a whole between aggregate disposable income and aggregate consumer spending

$$C = A + MPC × YD$$

--


Recall $M P C=\Delta \mathrm{C} / \Delta \mathrm{YD}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $\Delta \mathrm{YD}$, we get: 

$$M P C \times \Delta YD=\Delta C$$

In other words, when $YD$ goes up by  1, c goes up by $M P C \times 1$,


???
Same form as consumption function, just aggregate

# What causes shifts in C?

- __Changes in Expected Future Disposable Income:__
  - __Permanent income hypothesis:__ "Consumer spending depends on the expected income  over the long term rather than current income" 
  - For example, expectations of higher incomes lead consumers to spend more, shifting the aggregate consumption function up.

--

- __Changes in Aggregate Wealth:__  
  - __the life-cycle hypothesis:__"consumers plan their spending— they try to smooth their consumption—over their lifetimes"
  - For example, a rise in aggregate stock market indices

--

- Did the aggregate consumption function shift after WWII? 
???
—say, because of a booming stock market—increases aggregate autonomous consumer spending, shifting the aggregate consumption function up.

---

# Aggregate consumption shifted after WWII

```

- Panel (a) shows aggregate data on disposable income and consumer spending from 1929 to 1941 when a simple linear consumption function, CF1, fitted the data well.

- Panel (b) shows that the aggregate consumption function shifted up after World War II because consumers grew increasingly confident that economic boom would continue, and wealth was steadily increasing.

# THe effect of Taxes

A lump-sum tax will decrease disposal income

$$Y d=Y-T$$

- Thus, consumption function becomes:

$$C=a+M P C *(Y-T)=a+M P C * Y-M P C * T$$


--

- Equal changes in government spending and taxation lead to an equal change in income.

- If a $1 billion increase in spending is financed by a $1 billion tax increase, GDP rises $1 billion regardless of the MPC.

__THE BALANCED BUDGET MULTIPLIER IS ALWAYS 1__


???
The only difference is that the consumption decreases by $M P C * T$

# The Balanced Budget Multiplier

- Suppose we increase government spending and taxes both by $10 billion; what would happen to real GDP?

1. $\Delta Y$ from government purchases increase $=\Delta G \times \frac{1}{1-M P C}$
2. $\Delta Y$ from tax increase $=\Delta T \times \frac{-M P C}{1-M P C}$

--

So the overall $\Delta Y$ is the sum of these:
 $$\Delta Y= 10 \text{ billion} \times \frac{1}{1-M P C}+ 10 \text{ billion}  \times \frac{-M P C}{1-M P C} = 10  \text{ billion}$$

# The Balanced Budget Multiplier


- __Recessionary gap:__ the increase in aggregate spending necessary to bring a depressed economy back to full employment
- __Inflationary gap:__ the decrease in aggregate spending necessary to bring an overheated economy back to full employment"

--

- Inflationary pressures occur when an economy produces output above full employment 
- Excess spending results in higher prices, which can lead to other economic problems

--

-  The recessionary gap is the spending needed to close the GDP gap when boosted by the multiplier

# What about Exports and Imports?

- So far no international trade

--

- For the US economy good approximation, but not for Qatar

--

- After a change in income/wealth
  - consumption of both imported goods and local goods $\uparrow$
  - What matters for our story is $MPC_{local}$ vS $MPI$(imports)
  
--

- Exports is a source of income
  - If foreigners increase autonomous spending in goods we export:
  - generates a cycle similar to the one we studied

# What do you think happened?

- According to our book:

  - annual growth rate in N. Dakota between 2009 and 2012 was 15%
  - 3 times that of the US
--

- Most of the growth was from Mining, 31%
--

- But there was substantial increase in other sectors:
  - 17% in Wholesale
  - 9% in Retail
  - 12% in Finance

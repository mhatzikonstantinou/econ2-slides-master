  - __Currency in circulation:__ cash held by the public
  - __Checkable bank deposits:__ bank accounts on which people can write checks

--

- __The money supply:__ total value of financial assets, considered money.
  - __The narrower definition__ of money(most liquid):  currency in circulation and checkable bank deposits. 
  - __The broader definition__ narrow definition + “almost” checkable assets such as savings account deposits.

--

# Types of money

1.    __Commodity money:__ a good, normally gold or silver, used as a medium of exchange that has intrinsic value in other uses. 
2.    __Commodity-backed money:__ a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value; the ultimate value is guaranteed by a promise that it can be converted into valuable goods. 
  - The big advantage of commodity-backed money was that it tied up fewer resources: 
  - note-issuing banks kept only enough gold to 
  - satisfy demands for redemption of its notes, and it could lend out the remaining gold and silver.
3.    __Fiat money:__ money whose value derives entirely from its official status as a means of payment
  - Fiat money has two advantages. First, it doesn’t use up any real resources beyond the paper it’s printed on. 
  - Second, the supply of money can be adjusted based on the needs of the economy.
  - Fiat money has two disadvantages: it can be counterfeited, and 
  - governments can abuse the privilege of printing money.

# Measuring the money supply

__Monetary aggregate:__ an overall measure of the money supply

- __M1:__ includes only the most liquid forms of money.
- __M2:__ includes near-moneys: financial assets that can’t be directly used as a medium of exchange.

# Banks and monetary policy

- Roughly 43% of M1 is currency in circulation.
- Bank deposits make up more than half of M1 and most of M2.
- How does the banking system create money?

--

- Banks are financial intermediaries that use liquid assets to finance the illiquid investments of borrowers.
- Banks create liquidity, but do not lend all the deposits:
  - a bank must keep currency in the its vault or deposits at the Federal Reserve, 
- __Bank reserves:__ the currency that banks hold in their vaults plus their deposits at the Federal Reserve


---



# Banks: A review

__Bank:__ a financial intermediary that provides liquid assets to lenders and finances illiquid investment spending


--

- __Bank deposit:__ a claim on a bank that obliges the bank to give the depositor their cash when demanded
- __Bank Loan:__ a claim of a bank that determines the time of payments from lenders

--

- A bank is lending for long periods of time while deposits can be demanded  at any time. How can it manage that?
  - On average, only a small fraction of depositors will want their cash at the same time.
  - a bank keeps only a limited amount of cash on hand to satisfy its depositors.
  - bank deposits are guaranteed up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC.
  - __Bank runs__
  
  
--

- U.S. companies tend to issue bonds, while European companies rely on bank borrowing. Why the difference?

???
This reduces the incentive to withdraw funds if there are concerns about the bank.
U.S. businesses are more inclined to take risks. Also, European banks have more money than 
U.S. banks because Europeans tend to keep more money in banks than Americans

# Reserve ratios and Bank runs

.pull-left[
| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :---: |
| Loans | $1,200,000 | Deposits | $1,000,000 |
| Reserves | $100,000 |  |  |
]

.pull-right[

- __T-account:__ a tool for analyzing a business’s financial position by showing the business’s assets and liabilities
- __The reserve ratio:__ the fraction of bank deposits that a bank holds as reserves 
- The Federal Reserve sets a minimum required reserve ratio for banks.
]

--

- From time to time, people get worried about banks losing their money.
- __Bank run:__ a phenomenon in which many of a bank’s depositors try to withdraw their funds because they fear a bank failure
- In the 1930s, for example, the wave of bank runs swept across the United States. 
- In response to bank runs, the United States established a system of bank regulations that protect depositors.

# The Balance Sheet of a Bank

$$ \text { Leverage }=\frac{\text { Assets }}{\text { Your Skin in the Game }}=\frac{\text { Assets }}{\text { Equity }}$$

--

__How much capital should a bank have?__
  - remember that the reason banks hold equity is to absorb possible losses on the assets they own

--

__A model of a bank__: 

Assume a bank has an amount of debt (e.g. deposits) `\(D\)` and an amount of equity(net worth) `\((\bar{K})\)` also called capital. Its liabilities are `\(L=D+\bar{K}\)`, equal to its total assets: 


- Leverage ratio  `\(\lambda=\frac{\text { Assets }}{\text { Net Worth }}=\frac{L}{K}\)`

# Probability of default

What is the probability that a bank will go broke? 

It is the probability, that after a negative shock, the net worth becomes negative.
--

When is it higher?

- the higher the
fraction of total assets the bank invests in  risky assets, e.g. risky loans that
ofter lose their value

-  the higher the leverage ratio of the bank is. 


???
Banks may have a high λ and still be safe by keeping α lowñand indeed
this was thought to be the case for European banks which own lots of
"safe" government bonds. This is why Deutsche Bank was considered
safe even with a value of λ almost three times that of Citi.

# Bank regulation

Bank regulation has four main features: 

--

__Deposit insurance:__  a guarantee that a bank’s depositors will be paid even if the bank can’t come up with the funds 

--

__Capital requirements:__ requirement that the owners of banks hold substantially more assets than the value of bank deposits
  - Due to deposit insurance, banks can take more risks since they are insured.
  - __Solution:__ banks’ capital is required to equal 7% or more of their assets.

--

__Reserve requirements:__ rules set by the Federal Reserve that determine the minimum reserve ratio for a bank

__The discount window:__ an arrangement in which the Federal Reserve stands ready to lend money to banks in trouble

# Why Study Financial Markets?


- 2007-2009 Financial Crisis: 
  - the collapse of housing markets led to 
  - financial difficulties, e.g. the default of a major investment bank Lehman Brothers,

--

  - credit contraction and reduced profitability,
  - economic crisis, firms defaulted, firms freezed hiring and fired workers. 

--

  - The crisis transmitted  in several countries 
  
--

- 2019-2022: 
  - the recent pandemic led to a huge decline in production and consumption.
  - Firms could not support operations, increased subsidized lending + Fiscal Transfers

--

  - Fiscal Transfers in 2021 led to high demand and high prices
  - High commodity prices and high inflation changed expectations of consumers about prices
  
--
  - -> Increase in interest rates -> Recession???  __Poll__

# The Bond Market and Interest Rates
  - A __security__ (financial instrument) is a claim on the issuer’s future income or assets.
  - A __bond__ is a debt security that promises to make payments periodically for a specified period of time.

# Why Study:

_Study Money and Monetary Policy?_

- Evidence suggests that money, defined as anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods or services or in the repayment of debts, plays an important role in generating business cycles.
  - Recessions (unemployment) and expansions affect all of us.
  - Monetary theory ties changes in the money supply to changes in aggregate economic activity and the price level.
  
--

- The __aggregate price level__ is the average price of goods and services in an economy
- A continual rise in the price level (__inflation__) affects all economic players
- Data show a connection between the money supply and the price level

# Money and Interest Rates

- Interest rates = the price of money
- Prior to 1980, the rate of money growth and the interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds were closely tied
- Since then, the relationship is less clear, but the rate of money growth is still an important determinant of interest rates

# Money, Banking, and Financial Markets and Your Career

- Understanding monetary policy can help you 
  1. predict when interest rates will rise or fall, 
  2. make decisions about whether it is better to borrow now or to wait until later,
  3. know how banks and other financial institutions are managed which may
    - better deals when you need to borrow from them and 
    - better investment decisions, whether for yourself or for the company you work for

How We Will Study Money, Banking, and Financial Markets

- A simplified approach to the demand for assets
- The concept of equilibrium
- Basic supply and demand to explain behavior in financial markets
- An approach to financial structure based on transaction costs and asymmetric information

---

# Exploring the Web and Software

- The importance of the World Wide Web and statistical software is important several times:
  1. when we view the most current data for a high percentage of data figures (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED) 
  2.  at the end of almost every chapter there are several real-time data analysis problems, which ask you to download the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED database and then use these data to answer interesting questions.
  3. when we access additional Web exercises at the end of many chapters that prompt you to visit sites related to the chapter and use them to learn more about macroeconomic issues.
  4. when you prepare your presentation and paper.
  5. to automate process to follow the data and topics we study in the future.

# What you will learn 

- What makes macroeconomics different from microeconomics ?

--

  - Can you name some micro economic questions?

  -  How do you think macro economic thinking will be helpful?

--

__Some macroeconomic questions:__

--

- What is a business cycle is how would you measure the state of the aggregate economy ?

--

- What is long-run economic growth and how it determines a country's standard of living  ?

--

- What is the meaning of inflation and deflation and why price stability is preferred  ?

# Microeconomics versus Macroeconomics


- Microeconomics focuses on how decisions are made by individuals and firms and the consequences of those decisions.

--

  - Example: How much it would cost for a university or college to offer a new course ─ the cost of the instructor’s salary, the classroom facilities, the class materials, and so on.

  - Having determined the cost, the school can then decide whether to
offer the course by weighing the costs and benefits.

--

- Macroeconomics examines the aggregate behavior of the economy (that is, how the actions of all the individuals and firms in the economy interact to produce a particular level of economic performance as a whole).

--

  - Example: Overall level of prices in the economy (how high or how low they are relative to prices last year) rather than the price of a particular good or service.

--

- In macroeconomics, the behavior of the whole macroeconomy is greater than the sum of
individual actions:


--
  - __Paradox of thrift:__ when families and businesses are worried about the possibility of
economic hard times, they prepare by cutting their spending $\rightarrow$ This reduction in spending depresses the economy as consumers spend less and businesses react by laying off workers $\rightarrow$  families and businesses may end up worse off than if they hadn’t tried to act responsibly by cutting their spending.

---

# Theory and Policy

> “The long run is a misleading guide to current
affairs. In the long run we are all dead . Economists
set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in
tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that
when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.”

John Maynard Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) Ch. 3

--

- Modern Macroeconomics were born as a result of a need to deal with Great Depression

--

-  In a self regulating economy, problems such as unemployment
are resolved without government intervention, through the
working of the "invisible hand".

--

- According to Keynesian economics, economic slumps are
caused by inadequate spending and they can be mitigated by
government intervention.

--

- Monetary policy uses changes in the quantity of money to alter
interest rates and affect overall spending.

--

-  Fiscal policy uses changes in government spending and taxes to
affect overall spending.

•	Conduct a brief poll of your students to identify how they think the economy is doing. Have them each identify (by a show of hands, a voice vote, or on a slip of paper) whether they think the state of the economy is “excellent,” “good,” “fair,” or “poor.” Present the results of the poll to the class. 


Then ask your students to tell you on what they based their decision. What made them choose excellent, good, fair, or poor? They may say something about GDP, inflation, or unemployment. Keep a list of their responses. Ask them how their responses would have been different a year ago and five years ago. Use their sense of how things are going and how the state of the economy can change over time to lead into a discussion of the business cycle. 
•	Ask students to recall the actions that the government took during the recession of 2020. What were the short-term benefits of the government relief packages? (Alleviating the pains of unemployment and saving small businesses.) What are the long-term costs? (The increase in the public debt, the danger of high inflation in the future.)

# The Business Cycle

```{r  out.width = "70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/buscycle.png") 
```


- The business cycle is the short run alternation between
economic downturns and economic upturns. 
- Recessions are periods of economic downturns when output
and employment are falling. 
- Expansions , sometimes called recoveries , are periods of
economic upturns when output and employment are rising.



???
_The point at which the economy turns from expansion to
recession is a business cycle peak_.
_The point at which the economy turns from recession to
expansion is a business cycle trough_.


---

# What will we learn?

```{r  out.width = "50%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/buscycle2.png") 
```

???

- What happens during a business cycle, and what can be done about it?

??? 

--

- Fluctuations in unemployment and aggregate output

--

  - Recession: Employment $\downarrow$  
--
  
  - Recession: Output $\downarrow$


--

- What causes recession and how can policy makers change the economy?

???
. It is a good time to mention the deficit and debt levels and see what students think about them. Tell students that policy makers evaluate the economy by comparing the current data with average or benchmark values to get a sense for where we are. Mention that a downside of recession is higher-than-average unemployment. 


---

# Taming the Business Cycle

```{r  out.width = "60%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/jobopenings.png") 
```

???
Opening Example: In 2016, the unemployment rate in Greece was 24% and was much higher for people younger than 25 years. This extremely high unemployment rate is highlighted as a consequence of the Great Recession. The Great Recession is compared with the Great Depression (1929–1940) to show how economic policies might help or hinder recovery. 
Should I stay or go do a PhD? Will it matter if I was an engineer, economist, accountant?
---

# Taming the Business Cycle


- The business cycle is a main concern of modern policy makers in macroeconomics:
they try to smooth out the business cycle and reduce unemployment.

--

- Policy efforts undertaken to reduce the severity of recessions are
called stabilization policies .

--

- Two type of stabilization policies: 1. monetary policy : changes in the interest rate. 2. fiscal policy : changes in government spending, taxes, or both.

--

- To understand the impact of policies we need models! Classical vs. Keynesian models:

  - The classical approach: the idea that if there are free markets
and individuals conduct their economic affairs in their own
best interests, the overall economy will work well. Wages and prices adjust rapidly to get to equilibrium
  – Equilibrium: a situation in which the quantities
demanded and supplied are equal

--

  - Conclusion: Government should have only a limited role in the
economy

--

  - The Keynesian approach: Classical theory failed to explain persistent high unemployment during  The Great Depression. Keynes: Persistent unemployment occurs because wages and prices adjust slowly, so markets remain out of equilibrium for long periods
  
--

  - Conclusion: Government should intervene to restore full employment

??? 
Examples of monetary and fiscal policy:
•	In response to the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. government cut taxes and increased spending. The government actions were helping the depressed economy.
•	In response to the Great Recession of 2008, many European governments raised taxes and cut spending. The government actions were hurting the economy.
•	When a recession hit Brazil in 2014, the government cut spending. The government actions were hurting the economy.
•	When the coronavirus recession hit the United States in 2020, the U.S. government launched the $2 trillion relief package in March and the $3 trillion package in May. The government actions were helping the depressed economy.
Do we only care about fluctuations in employment and output?
---

# Inflation and Deflation


- A rising aggregate price level is __inflation__.

--

- A falling aggregate price level is __deflation__.

--

- The inflation rate is the annual percent change in the aggregate price level.

--

```{r  out.width = "70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/inflation.png") 
```

--

- The economy has price stability when the aggregate price level is changing only slowly.

???
Creating Student Interest 
•	Ask students how much a can of Coke costs. Have they ever heard anyone bring up the cost of a soda starting with “Well, back in MY day, a soda cost . . .”? Present the class with the following data: Coke was first sold in cans in the 1950s for 5 cents a can. By the end of the 1950s, the same can of Coke cost 10 cents. In 1960, the average price was about 13 cents, and by 1970 about 85 cents. Have students consider and speculate as to why the same can of soda costs so much more today than in the 1950s. Ask students if they believe the things they buy are getting more expensive. Make a list of some of the items they bring up. Ask them to guess the average rate of inflation in the United States. 
•	Ask students: Since inflation causes pain, should the United States target the zero percent inflation? Point out that many factors influence inflation, and if it turns into deflation, it will also cause pain to individuals and businesses.

---
# Long Run Economic Growth

--

- Long run economic growth is the sustained upward trend in the economy’s
output over time.

--

- A country can achieve a permanent increase in the standard of living of its
citizens only through long run growth.

--

```{r  out.width = "50%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/longrun.png") 
```

-  A central concern of macroeconomics is what determines long run economic growth.

???
Creating Student Interest 
•	Make sure students understand the definition of long-run growth as a sustained increase in the economy’s output over time. You might discuss the recent growth experiences of countries like China, India, and Brazil in comparison with the United States and Europe. You might ask students if they think economic growth is a good thing. Generally, they should say yes because economic growth leads to an increase in per capita income and living standards. You may have some students in class who are concerned about the environment, or running out of resources, and this can also lead to some interesting discussions. 
•	Tell students that a hundred years ago, Argentina was as rich and advanced as Canada or Germany. Today it’s a much poorer country than Canada or Germany. Ask them what went wrong in Argentina as opposed to Canada or Germany. Similarly, you can tell students that a hundred years ago, Britain was the richest and most advanced country in the world, while the United States was just one of many emerging economies. Today the United States is the economic and political leader of the world. Ask students what factors propelled the United States forward.
•	Ask students if they think the economy usually grows at a positive rate over time. They will probably say yes. Then ask them if they think most economies grow at a positive rate each year on average. They will probably say no, and this can lead to an interesting discussion about which countries are more and less developed.

# Short Review

  - A competitive market has many buyers and sellers of the same good or service, none of whom can influence the price.
  - The supply and demand model is a model of how a competitive market behaves.
The five key elements of this model:
  1. The demand curve
  2. The supply curve
  3. Factors that shift the demand curve and factors that shift the supply curve
  4. The market equilibrium
  5. Changes in the market equilibrium
  
???
Last time our discussion was informal
But I hope that generated some interest in macroeconomics
The important think is to provide you the tools that will help you
understand how the macroeconomy works, to help you be a better
economist-analyst-voter but I want you to remind you today
that as economists a lot of our discussion are based on 
simplified models and when you are thinking on individual cases
those models might not be the besto to apply . Emerging countries
are different than developed economies and the same messages are not 
uniform. However, economics would provide you with a lot of tools that 
you can use on your debates and decisions. A short review to set the stage
for the models and variables we will talk about.

__Key topics__

- Demand represents the behavior of buyers. Supply Represents the behavior of producers/sellers.

  - A demand schedule is a table showing how much of a good or service consumers will want to buy at different prices. A supply schedule shows how much of a good or service would be supplied at different prices. 

  - A demand curve shows the quantity demanded at various prices. A supply curve shows the quantity supplied at various prices


  - The law of demand and the law of supply

---

# Demand Schedule and Curve


```{r  out.width = "60%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/demandcurve.png") 
```


---

# Demand Shifts

.pull-left[

```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/demandshift1.png") 
```
]
--


.pull-right[

```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/demandshifts.png") 
```
]
 
???

Five factors that shift the demand curve: 
Changes in the prices of related goods or services 
Changes in income 
Changes in tastes 
Changes in expectations 
Changes in the number of consumers



---

# Supply Shifts



.pull-left[

```{r  out.width = "120%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/supplyshift.png") 
```
]
--


.pull-right[

```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/supplyshift2.png") 
```
]
 
 
???
Important supply shifters include changes in:
input prices.
the prices of related goods or services.
technology.
expectations.
the number of producers.

---

# Market Equilibrium

 - When $Q_s = Q_d$ at a certain price, the market is in equilibrium.

 - That is, the amount consumers would purchase at this price is matched exactly by the amount producers wish to sell.
 
 
```{r  out.width = "40%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week1graphs/equilibrium.png") 
```
 
 
 
???
 The price at which this takes place is the equilibrium price, also referred to as the market-clearing price. The quantity of the good or service bought and sold at that price is the equilibrium quantity
Ask class what happens:
  if price is too high or too low?
 if demand shifts down
 if supply shifts up
These are the mechanisms that we would like to explore in macroeconomics for specific
markets, e.g. housing market, + the economy as a whole and the first class
would be about that, how to measure the  total values goods and services 
that determine whether the economy is large or small

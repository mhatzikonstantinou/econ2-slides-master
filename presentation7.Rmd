# Recall

- The rate of return from holding a security equals the sum
  - of the capital gain on the security, 
  - any cash payments 
  - divided by the initial purchase price of the security.


$$R=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}+D_t}{P_{t}}$$

# The Theory of Rational Expectations 

- __Adaptive expectations:__
  - Expectations are formed from past experience only.
  - Changes in expectations will occur slowly 
    - as new information arrives.

- But: 
  1. People use more than just past data to form their expectations 
  2. People change their expectations quickly.

--

- __Rational expectations:__
  - Expectations = optimal forecasts using all available information.
      - does not mean the prediction is always perfectly accurate,
      - e.g. unaware of some relevant information.

- But: 
  - It takes too much effort to 
    1. obtain information
    2. make an expectation the best guess possible.

# The Theory of Rational Expectations 

- Rationale Behind the Theory in financial markets:

 - The incentives for equating expectations with optimal forecasts are especially strong
  - people with better forecasts of the future get rich.

- Efficient market hypothesis
  - Theory of rational expectations to financial markets 
  - Implications: 
    1. If there is a change in the behavior of a variable,
      - expectations of the variable   will change as well, e.g.
      - Changes in the conduct of monetary policy 
    2. The forecast errors of expectations will, on average, be zero and 
      - cannot be predicted ahead of time.

# Forming Expectations

  - At the beginning of the period, we know $P_{t}$ and $D_t$.  
  - $P_{t+1}$ is unknown and we must form an expectation of it. 

The expected return then is
$$R^{e}=\frac{P_{t+1}^{e}-P_{t}+D_t}{P_{t}}$$


- Expectations of future prices = optimal forecasts using available information:

$$P_{t+1}^{e}=P_{t+1}^{o f} \Rightarrow R^{e}=R^{of}$$

- But returns can not be far away from equilibrium returns: 

$$
R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}
$$

# The Efficient Market Hypothesis


Current prices are such that:
  - optimal forecast of a security’s return = the security’s equilibrium return.
  - a security’s price fully reflects all available information.
  - all unexploited profit opportunities will be eliminated

- Why does this imply $R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}$?

$$\begin{aligned}
&R^{\text {of }}>R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \uparrow \Rightarrow R^{o f} \downarrow \\
&R^{o f}<R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \downarrow \Rightarrow R^{o f} \uparrow
\end{aligned}$$

until

$$R^{o f}=R^{\star}$$

# Application

- How Valuable Are Published Reports by Investment Advisors?

> Information in newspapers and in the published reports of
investment advisers is readily available to many market
participants 

- What does that mean to you?

--

- This information is already reflected in market prices.
   - Acting on this information will not yield abnormally high returns, on average.
   - The empirical evidence for the most part confirms this.
   - Recommendations from investment advisors cannot help us outperform the market. Why?

- A hot tip is probably information already contained in the price of the stock.
  - Stock prices respond to announcements/news only when the information is new and unexpected.
  - A “buy and hold” strategy is the most sensible strategy for the small investor.

# Application

- What Do Stock Market Crashes Tell Us About the EMH?

--

- Nothing in efficient markets theory rules out large changes in stock prices.
- A large change in stock prices can result
    1. from new information 
    2. declines in optimal forecasts of the future valuation of firms
      - factors other than market fundamentals may have an effect on asset prices.

--

- Why the EMH Does Not Imply That Financial Markets Are Efficient

> Some financial economists believe all prices are always
correct and reflect market fundamentals (items that
have a direct impact on future income streams of the
securities) and so financial markets are efficient.

- Hard to reconcile with the fact that prices in the stock market are very unpredictable.
- How to do you explain large bubbles and crashes?
    - Behavioral Finance?

# Valuing the Aggregate Economy

Three ways to value a Stock Index
  - Replacement Cost
  - Price/Earnings
  - Discounted Dividends
  
--

Benchmarks for Economy 
  - Earnings = Profits 
  - Dividends = Cash flows to households
  - Balance Sheets = Assets owned by households
  
--

- Why?
  - The Total Value of US Corporations Has Risen over Time
  - But so did GDP? Is the stock market overvalued?

# How we measure the aggregate economy?

- NIPA and the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts
  - __GDP__: Expenditure equals output equals incomes 
  - Savings = Investment 
  - Household capital (directly owned houses and durable goods) 
  - Business capital (business are owned by households through intermediaries) 
  - Wealth of domestic households

#Table B.103 

- Ratio of Market Value of Corporate Equities to Net Worth 

- Net Worth is 
  - Non-Financial Assets at Replacement Value 
  - Plus Financial Assets 
  - Minus Liabilities

The Q Ratio is based on data from the Federal Reserve Z.1 Statistical Release, section B.103 Balance Sheet of Nonfarm NonfinancialCorporate Business. Specifically it is the ratio of Corporate Equities; Liability divided by Corporate Business; Net Worth. Data estimates before 1945 were provided by John Mihaljevic, Dr. Tobin's research assistant at Yale.

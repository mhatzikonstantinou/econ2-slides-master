# Recall

The rate of return from holding a security equals the sum of the capital
gain on the security, plus any cash payments divided by the initial
purchase price of the security.


$$
R=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}
$$
$R=$ the rate of return on the security
$P_{t+1}=$ price of the security at time $t+1$, the end of the holding period
$P_{t}=$ price of the security at time $t$, the beginning of the holding period
$C=$ cash payment (coupon or dividend) made during the holding period

# Forming Expectations

At the beginning of the period, we know $P_{t}$ and $C$. $P_{t+1}$ is unknown and we must form an expectation of it. The expected return then is
$$
R^{e}=\frac{P_{t+1}^{e}-P_{t}+C}{P_{t}}
$$


Expectations of future prices are equal to optimal forecasts using all currently available information so
$$
P_{t+1}^{e}=P_{t+1}^{o f} \Rightarrow R^{e}=R^{\circ f}
$$

- But returns can not be far away from equilibrium returns: 

$$
R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}
$$

# The Efficient Market Hypothesis

- Rational Expectations in Financial Markets


Current prices in a financial market will be set so that the
optimal forecast of a security’s return using all available
information equals the security’s equilibrium return.

In an efficient market, a security’s price fully reflects all
available information.

- In an efficient market, all unexploited profit opportunities will
be eliminated

- Why does this imply $R^{\text {of }}=R^{e}=R^{*}$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
&R^{\text {of }}>R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \uparrow \Rightarrow R^{\circ f} \downarrow \\
&R^{\circ f}<R^{*} \Rightarrow P_{t} \downarrow \Rightarrow R^{\circ o f} \uparrow
\end{aligned}
$$
until
$$
R^{\circ f}=R^{\star}
$$

How Valuable Are Published Reports by
Investment Advisors?

Information in newspapers and in the published reports of
investment advisers is readily available to many market
participants and is already reflected in market prices.

Acting on this information will not yield abnormally high
returns, on average.

The empirical evidence for the most part confirms that
recommendations from investment advisers cannot help
us outperform the general market.

Recommendations from investment advisors cannot help
us outperform the market.

A hot tip is probably information already contained in the
price of the stock.

Stock prices respond to announcements only when the
information is new and unexpected.

A “buy and hold” strategy is the most sensible strategy for
the small investor.

Application: What Do Stock Market Crashes Tell Us
About the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Efficiency
of Financial Markets?

Nothing in efficient markets theory rules out large changes
in stock prices. A large change in stock prices can result
from new information that produces a dramatic decline in
optimal forecasts of the future valuation of firms. However,
economists are hard pressed to find fundamental changes
in the economy that would have caused the Black Monday
and tech crashes. One lesson from these crashes is that
factors other than market fundamentals may have an effect
on asset prices.

Why the Efficient Market Hypothesis Does Not
Imply That Financial Markets Are Efficient

Some financial economists believe all prices are always
correct and reflect market fundamentals (items that
have a direct impact on future income streams of the
securities) and so financial markets are efficient.

However, prices in markets like the stock market are
unpredictable. This casts serious doubt on the stronger
view that financial markets are efficient.

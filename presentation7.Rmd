# What will you learn today?


- Why is long run economic growth measured as the increase in real GDP per capita?

- Why is productivity the key to long run economic growth? How is productivity measured?

- Why do long run growth rates differ so much among countries?

--

- __How does growth vary among several important regions of the world?__

- __Convergence Hypothesis and applications__

- __How does scarcity of natural resources and environmental degradation pose a challenge to sustainable long run economic growth?__

# Growth accounting

> __Growth accounting:__ estimates of the contribution of each major factor in the aggregate production function to economic growth

> __Total factor productivity:__ the amount of output that can be produced with a given amount of factor inputs

--

- When total factor productivity increases, the economy can produce more output with the same quantity of physical capital, human capital, and labor.

--

- Increases in total factor productivity are central to economic growth. 

- Technological progress drives increases in total factor productivity.

- According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the period from 1948 to 2019 American labor productivity rose 2.1% per year. 

- 49% of that rise is explained by increases in physical and human capital per worker; the rest is explained by rising total factor productivity—by  technological progress. 

- How do we know? 

---

# Total Factor Productivity 

- $TFP =\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{Y} / \mathrm{F}(\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{H})$
 
- Basically, TFP is a 'catch-all' for anything that effects output other than capital input $\mathrm{K}$ and education-adjusted labor input $\mathrm{L}$.

- Real GDP growth is declining over time.
- Capital has been growing faster than labor
- The contribution of productivity is diminishing!

# EAST ASIA’S MIRACLE (1 of 2)

It took South Korea only 35 years to achieve growth that required centuries elsewhere.
Since 1975, the East Asian region has increased real GDP per capita by 6% per year, more than three times America’s historical rate of growth.  
How have the Asian countries achieved such high growth rates?
Very high savings rates allow businesses to borrow and add more physical capital per worker. 
Very good basic education has permitted a rapid improvement in human capital. 
Substantial technological progress

--

Economic growth can be especially fast in countries that are playing catch-up to countries with higher GDP per capita.
East Asian economies grew fast because they adopted the technologies that already existed.
The convergence hypothesis: differences in real GDP per capita among countries tend to narrow over time
But having a low real GDP per capita is no guarantee of rapid growth, as the examples of Latin America and Africa demonstrate.

# LATIN AMERICA’S DISAPPOINTMENT

What’s holding Argentina (and other Latin American nations) back?


Irresponsible government action that eroded savings through high inflation
Lack of emphasis on education
Political instability

---

# AFRICA’S TROUBLES AND PROMISE 

What’s holding much of Africa back?
Government corruption
Civil wars and 
political instability
Unfavorable geography

Is Africa poor because it’s politically unstable or unstable because it’s poor? 
Good news: Growth rates are up in sub-Saharan African nations since 2011.

# THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH 

Government policies can increase the economy’s growth rate through the following six channels: 
Government subsidies to infrastructure
Infrastructure: roads, power lines, ports, information networks, and other underpinnings for economic activity
China spends more on infrastructure than Western Europe and North America combined.
Government subsidies to education
Literacy in China has been increasing more rapidly than in Argentina. This isn’t because China is richer than Argentina; it’s because the Chinese government has made education a priority.

--
Government subsidies to R&D
For example, the internet grew out of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), created by the U.S. Department of Defense.
Maintaining a well-functioning financial system
If people distrust banks, they’ll keep gold or cash in safe deposit boxes or under the mattress, where it cannot be turned into productive investment spending.
--

Protection of property rights
Property rights are the legal rights held by owners of valuable items to dispose of those items as they choose. 
Intellectual property rights are the rights of innovators to accrue the rewards of their innovations. 
Generally, governments protect intellectual property rights by giving patents (government-created temporary monopolies given to innovators for the use or sale of their innovations).
--

Political stability and good governance 
There’s not much point in investing in a business if rioting mobs are likely to destroy it.
Economic success of the United States has been possible because there are good laws, institutions that enforce those laws, and a stable political system that maintains those institutions

# IS WORLD GROWTH SUSTAINABLE?

Sustainable long-run economic growth: long-run growth that can continue in the face of the limited supply of natural resources and the impact of growth on the environment

--

“Neo-Malthusian” theories claim that economic growth will be severely limited by lack of resources.
Economists believe that modern economies handle scarcity fairly well. 
Resource scarcity leads to high prices, and these high prices provide strong incentives to conserve the resource and find alternatives. 
For example, after the sharp oil price increases of the 1970s, U.S. consumers turned to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.

# CLIMATE CHANGE AND GROWTH

```{r  out.width = "100%",echo=FALSE}

```

- The United States and Europe have historically been responsible for the great bulk of carbon dioxide emissions. 

- As China and other emerging economies have grown, they began to emit much more carbon dioxide.

# ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Economic growth tends to have the adverse impact on the environment: pollution, loss of wildlife habitats, extinction of species, and reduced biodiversity.
There’s local environmental degradation and global environmental degradation. 
It’s easier to reduce local environmental harm and it’s more difficult to address global environmental degradation, in particular, the problem of climate change.

Climate change: changes in Earth’s climate brought about by human activity 
Unmitigated climate change will cost 20% of world gross domestic product by 2100. Moreover, these costs tend to fall more heavily on poor countries. 
Climate change is been a hard problem to solve because it requires the cooperation of many countries.
Paris Agreement of 2015: 196 countries agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the rise in Earth’s temperature to no more than 2 degrees Celsius.
China and India agreed to limit their emissions, and the rich countries committed to help poorer countries pay the cost. 
The Trump administration announced plans for the United States to withdraw from the agreement in November 2020.

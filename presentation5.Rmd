# Risk Structure of Interest Rates 


```{r  out.width = "60%", fig.align="center",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week5graphs/ltbonds.png")
```


Bonds with the same maturity have different interest rates due to:

- Default risk

- Liquidity
  - Cost of selling a bond
  - Number of buyers/sellers in a bond market

- Tax considerations

# Risk Structure of Interest Rates 


Default risk: probability that the issuer of the bond is
unable or unwilling to make interest payments or pay off
the face value

U.S. Treasury bonds are considered default free
(government can raise taxes).

Risk premium: the spread between the interest rates
on bonds with default risk and the interest rates on
(same maturity) Treasury bonds

# Two Tales

- The Global Financial Crisis and the Baa–Treasury Spread:

> Starting in August 2007, the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market led to large losses among financial
institutions. As a consequence, many investors began to
doubt the financial health of corporations with low credit
ratings such as Baa and even the reliability of the ratings
themselves. The perceived increase in default risk for
Baa bonds made them less desirable at any given price.

--

- The Coronavirus Pandemic Crisis and the Baa–Treasury Spread:


> When the coronavirus officially became a pandemic in
March 2020, the resulting lock-downs and social
distancing dealt a knockout blow to the world economy.
Many investors began to doubt the financial health of
corporations with low credit ratings such as Baa.
The perceived increase in default risk for Baa bonds
made them less desirable at any given price, decreased
the quantity demanded, and shifted the demand curve for
Baa bonds to the left.

# Term Structure of Interest Rates 

Bonds with identical risk, liquidity, and tax characteristics
may have different interest rates because the time
remaining to maturity is different

Yield curve: a plot of the yield on bonds with differing
terms to maturity but the same risk, liquidity, and tax
considerations

Upward-sloping: long-term rates are above
short-term rates

Flat: short- and long-term rates are the same

Inverted: long-term rates are below short-term rates


---

# Term Structure of Interest Rates 

The theory of the term structure of interest rates must
explain the following facts:

Interest rates on bonds of different maturities move
together over time.

When short-term interest rates are low, yield curves
are more likely to have an upward slope; when
short-term rates are high, yield curves are more likely
to slope downward and be inverted.

Yield curves almost always slope upward.


Three theories to explain the three facts:

Expectations theory explains the first two facts but not
the third.

Segmented markets theory explains the third fact but
not the first two.

Liquidity premium theory combines the two theories to
explain all three facts.

# U.S. Government Bonds With Different Maturities

```{r  out.width = "80%", fig.align="center",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("week5graphs/maturity.png")
```

---

# Expectations Theory 

The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal an
average of the short-term interest rates that people
expect to occur over the life of the long-term bond.

Buyers of bonds do not prefer bonds of one maturity over
another; they will not hold any quantity of a bond if its
expected return is less than that of another bond with a
different maturity.

Bond holders consider bonds with different maturities to
be perfect substitutes.

---

# An example:

Let the current rate on one-year bond be 6%.

You expect the interest rate on a one-year bond to be 8%
next year.

Then the expected return for buying two one-year bonds

averages

The interest rate on a two-year bond must be 7% for you
to be willing to purchase it.

---

# Return on 2-year bond

For an investment:
- $i_{t}=$ today's interest rate on a one-period bond
- $i_{t+1}^{e}=$ interest rate on a one-period bond expected for next period
- $i_{2 t}=$ today's interest rate on the two-period bond

Expected return over the two periods from investing $1 in
the two-period bond and holding it for the two periods

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(1+i_{2 t}\right)\left(1+i_{2 t}\right)-1 \\
=1+2 i_{2 t}+\left(i_{2 t}\right)^{2}-1 \\
=2 i_{2 t}+\left(i_{2 t}\right)^{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

- the expected return for holding the two-period bond for two periods is


$$
\begin{gathered}
2 i_{2 t}
\end{gathered}
$$


---

# Return on two one-period bonds


For an investment:
- $i_{t}=$ today's interest rate on a one-period bond
- $i_{t+1}^{e}=$ interest rate on a one-period bond expected for next period
- $i_{2 t}=$ today's interest rate on the two-period bond


$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(1+i_{t}\right)\left(1+i_{t+1}^{e}\right)-1 \\
1+i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}+i_{t}\left(i_{t+1}^{e}\right)-1 \\
i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}+i_{t}\left(i_{t+1}^{e}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

- If the second term is very small,  the expected return is 

$$i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}$$

- Both bonds will be held only if the expected returns are equal

$$i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e} = 2i_{2t}$$

$$i_{2 t}=\frac{i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}}{2}$$

---

# Expectations Theory

For bonds with longer maturities
$$
i_{n t}=\frac{i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}+i_{t+2}^{e}+\ldots+i_{t+(n-1)}^{e}}{n}
$$
The $n$-period interest rate equals the average of the one-period interest rates expected to occur over the $n$-period life of the bond

Expectations theory explains:

Why the term structure of interest rates changes at
different times.

Why interest rates on bonds with different maturities
move together over time (fact 1).

Why yield curves tend to slope up when short-term
rates are low and slope down when short-term rates
are high (fact 2).

Cannot explain why yield curves usually slope upward
(fact 3)

---

# Segmented Markets Theory

Bonds of different maturities are not substitutes at all.

The interest rate for each bond with a different maturity is
determined by the demand for and supply of that bond.

Investors have preferences for bonds of one maturity
over another.

If investors generally prefer bonds with shorter maturities
that have less interest-rate risk, then this explains why
yield curves usually slope upward (fact 3).

---

# Liquidity Premium 

The interest rate on a long-term bond will equal an
average of short-term interest rates expected to occur
over the life of the long-term bond plus a liquidity
premium that responds to supply and demand conditions
for that bond.

Bonds of different maturities are partial (not perfect)
substitutes.

- Liquidity Premium Theory 

$$i_{n t}=\frac{i_{t}+i_{t+1}^{e}+i_{t+2}^{e}+\ldots+i_{t+(n-1)}^{e}}{n}+l_{nt}$$

- $l_{nt}$ is the liquidity premium
  - always positive
  - Rises with the term to maturity
  
---

# Preferred Habitat Theory

Investors have a preference for bonds of one maturity
over another.

They will be willing to buy bonds of different maturities
only if they earn a somewhat higher expected return.

Investors are likely to prefer short-term bonds over
longer-term bonds.

# Predictions


Interest rates on different maturity bonds move together
over time; explained by the first term in the equation

Yield curves tend to slope upward when short-term rates
are low and to be inverted when short-term rates are
high; explained by the liquidity premium term in the first
case and by a low expected average in the second case

Yield curves typically slope upward; explained by a larger
liquidity premium as the term to maturity lengthens
